4,"Great app. So far I am very new to this app, however from what I’ve experienced, most of the negative reviews are from beginners that did not take the time to read and understand what they were getting themselves into. I currently have the jade green card and I can say that I have already received my Netflix rebate so that works. I have not tried to withdraw my funds yet as I’m waiting on my money to transfer so I can test everything, however I have spend money with the virtual card and got my money back in cro that way as well. So far it has done everything it should. Also, I have experienced one problem with my card info not displaying on one of my devices however the customer support has been great and they are working on it. If you find yourself with that problem, I would recommend trying a different device if possible. In the end customer support has been kind and respectful and if you take the time to understand the fees that this app should help you earn some serious cash. In the end, just do test payments and be 100% sure of what should happen and be patient. I just hope that they get a website working and one point, other than that I am happy with what I have :)",2021-08-25 19:03:14,$cashguy$,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
5,"WONDERFUL APP RATING. Today Bitcoin is more than just an asset, Bitcoin has been 100x better investment than anything else in the past 10 years, you can Google it yourself. Bitcoin is both a currency and technology, and only few people understand how to maximize profits and huge returns in short period of time. I was fortunate to meet Expert Alexcybertech01 [At]Gmail, a cryptocurrency expert on a Bitcoin blog online. I contacted him for guidance, we talked for while and i did subscribe to their bitcoin investment/mining program, believe it or not he made me 245,700 USD in a couple of weeks and i was very much impressed at his skills, and i only started with a small amount. Before i met him, I was a bit careless with security features strong passwords earlier when i started up on Coinbase and was hacked with over 36,000 USD in bitcoin stolen from my wallet, when i told him about it, he just requested for details of hacked transaction in my wallet and all transaction details, he traced the hackers wallet addresses they moved my coins to and extracted all my coins back from the blockchain network within 24hours. I had a bet with him that if he could truly get back my coins i will let the world know about him. You can drop him mail at, Alexcybertech01 via Gmail, Good luck.",2022-09-19 16:59:10,Phyna0803,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"Doesn’t allow you to buy crypto after a while using the app.. I’ve been using the app for about 6 months now and was actually enjoying it. But for the past week I have been trying to buy different crypto and everytime I try, it never goes through. There is always a blank white page after trying to buy anything. Sometimes in will say there is an error that occurred. So I contacted the app through the chat and they could not help me at all. The help chat is completely useless in this issue. I asked if there was a number to call but the chat doesn’t help you with that either. Then I figured maybe it’s my bank that is not letting the transaction happen but I called my bank and they said they haven’t stopped anything or seen any attempts to buy crypto from the app. Today I tried to delete my card information from the app and then re enter my card information to buy some crypto to see if that would make it work. To my surprise the error occurred did not pop up this time but instead the app says that my card issuer declined the transaction and to call my bank to fix the issue. Well I did call them again to see if now they where declining it and they told me again there was no attempt to buy any crypto from the app. My bank didn’t decline anything. So the app is just falsely accusing that my bank declined it. This app has to many bugs and when you need help for anything there isn’t anyone to actually talk to. It’s trash.",2021-12-18 16:35:32,4120angel4120,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"Investors beware. This app started great, it has many good features like the airtime pay for cellphone service that you can use with the Crypto that your holding. The downfall happened to me recently after securing the account with 2fa. In the beginning of the account security it was great, transfer went smooth, but then there was a attack on CRYPTO last month that caused some disturbances resulting in a 2fa reset forcing certain users to apply this change. Since this was done for me already it didn’t bother me until I went to transfer funds to discover the 2fa was not accurate. This is where the problem started. I contacted customer service and the bot spat out a inaccurate solution resulting in me texting a random agent that request that I submit a video for “security” reasons. After providing said video, it was not good enough, so I have to change email address to “secure” the account. I thought it was over until I get another email saying “he he hee” we need another video of glycine hiding a ransom sign. Now the crypto card I have is frozen and this is still a ongoing issue.

Update: In order to Get back into the account I had to literally submit 8 MORE VIDEOS!!! Keep in mind that it’s in a UNSECURE EMAIL, which means your identity will be compromised by another party to be used without your knowledge. This is a Major concern of mine and with the current trend I’m not sure if I will be victimized by this FORCED “security” policy.

Again beware…..",2022-02-18 13:39:08,crypto jj,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"DO NOT download or put money in this app!. I’m an Admin in a trading group and we all share different ideas and alert each other of apps that steal your money.  This APP is horrible!!!!  On this app I had most of my money in ALGO (Algorand).  It took a nice 20% increase and I went to go take the profits and move them to CRO.  MAGICALLY my ability to trade was stopped!  I contacted them, took screen shots,  let them know what was going on and that I was losing my profits by the second….  They responded saying it would be fixed later.  Not “let us trade it where you need it or anything of the sort”. They waited until it dropped all the way down to what I bought it at!  Then had the audacity to say, and I quote ”. Thanks for the reply. I totally understand, however, the issue was resolved and you were able to withdraw the funds.
If you have additional questions do not hesitate to get back to us.”   They basically said screw you the same way Robin Hood app does. Scams.   COINBASE and COINBASE PRO is the way to go.  DO NOT GET SCAMMED WHEN YOU SHOULD BE MAKING MONEY!  Again, do not use this app.  Buy rates are always off compared to the actual market and always in their favor.  They say on these reviews “contact us and we’ll look into it” but they just blow you off once they scam you.  You buy for more than the market and sell for less and they don’t let you sell if your currency you’ve put money in pumps.  I wish I could put negative stars instead of one.",2021-06-09 22:15:50,Tommyloansu,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
2,"Not too happy. At the beginning, I was happy with this app it is a nice app in the sense that you can earn additional income from owning the different crypto assets. The only issue and the biggest issue that I have is that when I try to make purchases with my debit card, it’s a hit and miss and more often than not It is a miss. When I try to make a purchase some of the times it will go through most of the times it doesn’t go through and the issue is not my bank it is the application. I tried to go through their customer service, but their best advice was to transfer money to the application. What if I don’t want to transfer money, I want to use my debit card so I can purchased the crypto as I go along. Also,If you have a customer that is telling you there’s an issue with a certain part of the application why not try to resolve the issue instead of telling them to not use that part of the application and do their purchases a different way. Overall, yes I do like the application, but I get frustrated very often with it because of the fact that I cannot make my purchases that easily. When I started using the application, all my purchases were going through nice and easy but now I do not know what it is that they did and it is just not that easy. Hope you improve this app and make it work the proper way.",2022-01-27 12:46:59,Fosejo,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
5,"Fantastic Platform!. Do all of your DD before diving into digital currency. This platform is fantastic for both beginners and veterans alike. There are many benefits baked in and from my experience, Once I’ve initiated an ACH transfer from my personal account, I’ve had access to the funds within 24 hours, in my Crypto account. That is a huge deal. I’ve used Other platforms where transfers have taken 3 days to complete, and up to nearly 3 weeks. Hoo-rah to this team for creating a quick process, among all the other benefits of their platform!!! One suggestion - I don’t believe any of these platforms have utilized yet - Y’all should integrate a way for users to buy crypto with their “Apple” balance or Apple gift cards. If I were to receive a gift card, other than shopping, I can’t convert the balance into fiat, but it’d be wonderful to sink that balance or gift card into CRO, ETH, SHIB, etc… When a user initiates a buy order, the app gives about 12 seconds to confirm, I believe that’s because of price fluctuation. I wonder if the same concept could be used to buy increments of altcoins - i.e. $20 for 20 worth of CRO… ? Either way, great job, keep it going, and hoo-rah!

3,"Just not sure anymore. So let me begin this review by stating I have only been into crypto for a year. With that being said I am still learning but I have also experienced a whole lot with some hard learned lessons in that year as well. Okay, so I looked up all these other exchanges binance, Coinbase, robinghood etc etc. i had tons of difficulties until I found cryptoapp. I found this app very simple to use and not confusing buy and sell transfer simple. And I also found that the customer service was always there to help and quick with responses and all of my issues were resolved. However in the las week I have noticed that I am not able to top up my card with the same debit card I have been using this whole time and cryptodotcom cannot help me out just tells me to use a different card so I did and yeah exactly, still unable reached back out and they don’t know and can’t help. So then I tried to make a purchase and yeah same issue and yeah they cannot help. And I am also seeing others on social media are having the same issue. I used to believe this app was going to take over the crypto space bc of their customer service but now I’m not so sure and I can only give 3 stars now. Bery disappointed with their customer service as of late so sad.",2022-01-09 16:17:26,Regieein Cali,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
4,"Great for new users. Been using app for about 8 months, easy to use, you do get harassed with proving your income, way beyond reason, in to things that is frankly none of there business, wife closed her account as a result.  Also it’s said buying at true cost, but the fees hidden on exchange from trading a coin. Was not easy to find costs ahead of time for me at least. It is easy on and off for through ACH with Chase bank, had trouble with 2 other smaller banks limited to 1k and 5k transfers, chase allows 25k, once I did a withdrawal and had no issue. They just now opened up US to use a separate program to exchange tokens ( coins), so should be less expensive fees in trading and remember you will pay transfer fees to other crypto wallets ( called gas fees), but the coins moved dictate the amount, due your research before trading to check tax consequences for each and every transaction, can be a nightmare! I gave app 4 stars, over all better that Coinbase as far as I’m concerned. Look at there debit card choices, nice options and rewards. Other features are nice like staking stable coins, however they just announced a reduction in interest in staking those. Overall great company, growing leaps and bounds",2022-03-16 07:31:10,Snicklefritzmen,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"Scam Alert! DO NOT INSTALL CRYPTO APP. UPDATE: I have been in contact with the Crypto support team. It is the absolute worst! Now, every time I send an email asking them the status of my money, this is the response I get:”We are awaiting an update from our dedicated team.  As soon as we have an update, we will let you know.”  BTW, this has been going for over one week!!  When I used to transfer money from my account to Crypto, it took a couple of seconds. There were no issues at all. Now getting my money from Crypto has become the biggest headache!  I REGRET downloading this app!

I have been trying to withdraw my money from Crypto into my bank account. They use Plaid to connect to your financial institution. For some reason, Plaid throws an error message stating ‘Something went wrong. Please try again later’. This has been going on for a few days. Crypto support says the issue is with Plaid, and they can’t give me Plaid support contacts. When I got with Plaid, they say to contact Crypto. I have done all the troubleshooting steps Crypto told me to do, and still doesn’t work. But surprisingly, there’s absolutely no issues using Plaid to withdraw money from my bank account and sending it to Crypto. No error messages there. But trying to get my money from Crypto to my bank account somehow, miraculously doesn’t work. Crypto is basically now telling me there’s nothing they can do about it!!!",2022-06-14 14:21:16,Agugz,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
4,"Great service but..... There service is great. Very easy or somewhat easy to navigate, it took me a little while to understand everything, but now I get it. I was able to deposit money on my Crypto account from my debit card pretty smoothly. Taking money out is pretty straight forward as long as your bank is on the list of compatible banks (which are big name banks and credit unions) I have a very small credit union so I had to open a bank account that was on that list. Pretty common with most app involving bank linking. The only thing I would like to be improved is faster customer service. They will always help you and resolve your issues but you just got to have patience. I understand because of the increased interest in Crypto which increases customers which inevitably increases issues. That being said...customer service response time: ⭐️⭐️⭐️. customer service helpfulness/problem resolution ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Platform and navigation through app ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Information and transparency ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. Anyway I love this app so far and I think you should give it a chance.

5,"Most fun I've ever had getting rich. Turning a few hundred bucks into tens of thousands, even while I'm sleeping is the most fun I've erer had buying stuff!  I've heard my whole life ""pay yourself first"" but that amounted to impulse buys for more junk I simply don't need, burying me in useless detritus I can never find when I need it 'cause it's buried under other just as useless rubble!  Buying crypto gives me that endorphin hit I desire without increasing the amount of stuff soffocating my very existence.  It's also hitting that betting urge and at much better odds then any casino.  Advice,  buy for the long term, only spend free money that you would've wasted on something mundane.  I started by buying 20,000 shares of VET @.02 cents ea. It's now at about,07, buts been as high as .11, I have no doubt that future readers of this review will look back on these figures and wish they bought in while it was so undervalued.  In closing:  I'm not a financial advisor and money runs through my fingers like water through a net, this app after so many failed attempts to save money has finally allowed us a savings.

1,"New investors beware. If you’re new to the app because you’ve fallen for CDCs marketing, or maybe a friend recommend the app to you, be careful. CDC has been very very shady the past few months. They change huge polices over night, multiple times a month, and without notice. At least recently. You can’t trust them. Don’t fall into the trap too of getting one of their cards because they can slash those rates overnight (as they did) and then “upgrade it” slightly to make it seem like they’re doing you a favor lol look up some of their Reddit forums and you’ll see how much of the community, especially a lot of their older loyal investors, have been screwed over lately. You can’t trust these guys because they don’t communicate ANY changes they’re going to make. Or if they do by chance, they’ll enact it days before the announced date just to throw everyone for a loop and screw them up that way. The only people who will try to convince you that CDC is still good are the people who invested more than they can afford to lose in CRO (their crypto). They’re afraid if CDC goes down, CRO will go down and they’ll lose money. My advice is to use coinbase instead. Never had any problems with them. CDC also recently reversed transactions when people were trading and making profits!!

3,"Good and bad. I really like using this app to trade cryptos because it is fast and has great coverage of many coins out there. I think it is shady that there’s a magic “premium” added to coins when BTC is rising, and this is a money grab in my opinion because that premium is not applied when you sell. For example, CRO was .1210 when I tried to buy, and after doing the math (which is not provided because they know it’s shady) my average cost was somewhere around .125. Not a huge difference but that is hard earned profit by this point. I have been trying to get my CRO card for weeks now and I have been told that the only way I can continue with my application is to provide a picture of my SSN card. This was due to me moving addresses multiple times in the past few years because I am a college student. It is very frustrating and the support, albeit responds in a timely manner, does not seem like they really want to get you to your end goal. With all that said, I still trade here and love checking in on my cryptos. Unfortunately, after my staking period WHICH IS DUMB BECAUSE I DID NOT EVEN RECEIVE A CARD is over I will be transferring my balance to coin base or some other more reliable system.",2021-09-09 15:57:47,#j-wat,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
4,"Crypto Best app with Extraordinary service. Loosing ones Crypto currency can be a devastating thing to experience, the fact that it is almost impossible to recover a Stolen or lost Crypto coin hurt more than anything. When a person get scammed of their money while investing in a crypto currency platform the only thing they can think of is how to report the company and get back their money. Most victims of the scam contact their wallet account provider, their bank or the law enforcement, a few end up hiring a lawyer to sue the company but after all these stress they still cant get their money back. Please everyone should be careful where they invest their money. Bitcoin has made many rich and at the same time made so many broke and desperate. Few weeks ago when I was referred to Spycjonnes and I was able to get back all my dogecoin that was Stolen through their services.

1,"Deceitful with terrible customer service. I’ll start with the positive. And the ONLY positive is the variety of Cryptocurrencies they operate with. But that does no good because their price reporting is inaccurate. I figured it was a bug and reached out to support. They did nothing but copy and paste responses, and when I tried to get them to elaborate on what I’m asking I was told to “consider the subject exhausted.” Meaning they had no interest in telling me what I was trying to find out. They will show and record incorrect or higher than market prices, and those prices are shown when buying, but if you already own a coin, and go to sell at that same time, the selling price is magically way lower than any other price they’re showing. They’re graphs only load when they want, I couldn’t even try to tell you the refresh rate. I found out all of that AFTER trying to figure out how to move my money around in they’re system. You can buy with a card no problem for a fee, but when you go to sell or withdraw your funds you must make a separate wallet account, attach your bank account to it, and then start a withdrawal that takes a day.

1,"Slow, glitchy, and mild scamming. First off im in the US, which means this app offers a lot that many here don't.
The issue is that the app is almost unusable. If anyone says this app is easy, they were lucky or lying. Banks consider it a scam, so just getting past that is a pain, but even if you do the app has an extreme chance of just glitching. Then if you do manage to begin trading there can be serious delays of over a week making it difficult to make time sensitive decisions. Lastly is what i consider to be mild scamming regarding transfers. Transferring into the app was very easy... Transferring out after being disappointed was obviously set up to be difficult. Setting up transfers is extremely glitchy and made me have to write down addresses manually because the app would glitch every time i went to copy one. Also with minimum limits far higher than the ones set for transferring in, i literally couldn't take out what i put in. Lastly the app is just simply slower and clunkier than any other crypto app ive found. 
I would consider this a work in progress except they have spent so much time and resources over the past year on marketing instead of development, so my hopes were completely gone.",2021-05-19 03:13:17,WilliamI7,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"High withdraw Minimum, bad 2fa for some, high withdraw fees. All of these problems are only issues for the user who is moving under $1000 dollars per transaction. Their withdraw min is currently .003btc which at the time of this review is around $150. Small time funds will always be locked unlike many other exchanges with much lower, usually 0.001, or with Gemini, 0. If you’re using this to invest small time money of DCA I highly recommend turning away. This app has a $20 withdraw fee at .0004btc to move it to any more secure wallets. Their 2fa bugged out and I had to reset it. I had to spend over 4 days sending and buying funds to get enough btc to finally withdraw just to discover there’s a $20 withdraw fee. Every other exchange I can think of has fees so small they’re still under $10 when moving thousands. Half of this bad experience is due to my negligence of not researching withdraw mins and fees. So it goes to show to do your research. Either way it would not have ch aged my opinion, My mistake doesn’t negate that this app still has high withdrawal mins, high fees, and high withdraw fees. Steer clear really, their cards aren’t really too worth it if your a small fish. You need $1000s of dollars to get the food benefits.",2021-12-21 18:00:58,Kedit_yt,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"DEFLECTS ISSUES TO T&C’s NO ACCOUNTABILITY. I had been investing on the app for a few months now and a few days ago I had trouble accessing my account from the app. I reached out to the company and explained my situation. Whomever I was communicating with locked my account and on multiple occasions and asked me to prove I was the account holder. When they finally unlocked my account I was missing hundreds of dollars from it. I again reached out to the company and explained the situation to be locked out again. They do not have a number you can reach to speak to someone and every time I asked for one the question was ignored. After emailing back and fourth they finally sent me over to their claims department to have the theft reviewed and within a day I got a response that the T&C (terms and conditions) would not hold them accountable for any theft or unauthorized account access and was unable to get my money back. That I should have secured that account better even though I used every security feature it offered (authenticator, secure email account, wallet credentials).

2,"Great UI…. But the fees are exaggerated, the limits to withdraw and deposit are insane especially for beginners and the worst - the amount of time they process withdrawals to another wallet takes forever. If a bitcoin can take awhile to process normally imagine with this platform, it’ll take maybe 10 times longer, its definitely not instant so if you pay someone using this platform expect to wait for confirmations or just pay whoever you are paying with cash - it might be easier or use other wallet like “ALL the other ones” so you don't have to wait for THEIR confirmations. I went to get a haircut expecting to get in and out and i ended up waiting another hour after my haircut because my payment wont transfer instantly. Time is Gold! And not to mention they use lingos that are so confusing in their App. I don’t know why i kept using this platform after close to 3 years of having this all the way back in the day when MCO was cool. Maybe because i try to give the benefit of a doubt for products i am loyal to regardless of the services, but sometimes loyalty becomes a chore and everything else falls apart.",2022-06-09 21:44:53,F.

1,"Scam app!  Allow login but block access to assets!. Thus company made an app that can lock you out of your wallet when they want to.
This means they can block users from buying or selling at a time you can make or protect from loosing money.  
No app like that should have been allowed on Apple store.  This is criminal fraud!  Intent to commit fraud is a crime and using it to do so a crime.
Who is responsible to bring justice?  Yeah no one! So whatever money you put in here be prepared to login and see it disappear but not actually transact as a built in option they control.
The bug users reported they say was fixed. Well they now allow access and show totals that are accurate but individually block use for transactions. That’s fraud at its best.  If you now closed my account then give me my wallet I’d?  You had no problem taking my money.  It takes weeks of them telling me it’s my phone now they say senior management close my account?  Hello - Um where my money?  How many weeks till I can transfer my assets or cash out?  What a joke!

Then, it turns out they “can’t verify” me... not sure why. No option to check pictures or answer questions or anything, so I reached out to customer service again. Same thing, no response until several hours later in the middle of the night, only to tell me THEY DONT HAVE TO TELL why they reject people, and then closed the chat because I wasn’t responsive.  Super disrespectful to treat people like that who have trusted them with their sensitive info.

3,"SLOW and crazy incorrect notifications. App looks great. I wanted to invest in CRO just bcos of how app is designed that gives confidence on it. But there is so much pain buying it. Eventually I staked CRO. First none of Credit cards in US works atleast what I hold. And then so much delay in transferring money to Fiat balance (4 or 5 days) by the time you end up investing thro other exchanges.  Even if u transfer most of time it’s slow and especially when big market movements and u wanted to use ur debit card to make faster purchase. Now it’s not even showing debit card option.

I wanted to highlight the notifications issue that's annoying so much. For the cryptos you track when you receive notifications abt price changes it's totally incorrect for the time. Price u see in notification and what you see after you tap to open are totally different. Not just by a fraction but by so many percentages. For example I see notification for  $1.82 up by 10% but upon opening it shows $1.55 down %. I end up disabling the notifications for now",2021-05-29 02:25:47,Smartkarthi,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us

However, my account got hacked and they emailed me, stating there were abnormalities and unusual activity in my account. They locked my account and made me jump through hoops to get it unlocked, (sending at least 10 different selfies, stating pics were too far, too close etc. and some other steps.) when I regained access the majority of my tokens/coins were gone. I made them aware of the missing coins/tokens and they said they would investigate it. Again, they made me jump through hoops to start the investigative process. (Again with the selfies and other steps etc.) After a few days they sent me an email and said, there are no abnormalities with your account, we concluded you are responsible for the missing coins/tokens. Very strange since they informed me there was unusual activity with my account and locked it. I wasn’t even aware of it. I guess they didn’t want to replace the tokens/coins or admit they were hacked, who knows. I filed complaints with the SEC and FTC.

1,"Falls really short. I was really excited about this app based on what it was supposed to do.  It does not do what it should.  The UI is extremely difficult to understand since they use odd terminology that would normally mean other things like “transfer” might mean to another wallet and not from one coin to another or you might need to select the word “sell” when you just want to convert one coin to another.  It gets really confusing and is not user friendly at all.  Support is very, very poor.  I ordered the debit card and got an email saying it had been sent but it didn’t come.  After a couple weeks I wrote to support but they never answered.  I finally got the card two weeks later and activated it.  I tried to top it off with the balance the app said I had but my balance was in their coin and it doesn’t have an option to use that for the card.  I tried to sell their coin but it said it was locked.  It turns out, the balance was from their “gift” which can’t be unlocked unless I buy more coins and stake them.  It was complete deceit.

It’s a multi purpose crypto wallet with the feel of a large bank! One thing I do think they need is a desktop platform.. so far they’re in the number one spot for the market they target, but imo a desktop version would give them a significant advantage over their competitors. As far seeing the bad reviews on here... working in business myself, reading the negative reviews then using the app.. I can say in full confidence that the negative reviews are due to user error lol regardless, give this app a chance! It won’t disappoint.

I just got a blank empty screen.. I called my bank, but they had no record of the attempts) the app will frequently freeze up and I had to attempt my first few purchases multiple times because the price would update.. this is fine, except it would kick me all the way back to the Home Screen and make me start over.

After trying multiple different types of payment methods from debit to credit cards and being unsuccessful at every turn, I don’t have so much as a customer service number to call and speak to anyone about this. I’ve spoken to my banks multiple times and after asking several times for a customer service number during these message conversations, I have yet to receive a number or response regarding my question. It’s been a 3-day process and I have yet to be able to invest a single dollar because of this flawed system.

If I trade my coins, they go to some unknown location and I can’t do anything with them and I lose money while while the app freezes. If I buy coins- again it doesn’t show and my coins are off in la la land not making money. I don’t even have access to my money and I can’t buy when prices are good. This app is HORRIBLE.

4,Okay I’m doing a new review.. I’m only giving four stars because you really need to do your homework to learn about prices. The coins themselves have different sale % that come off the top. Crypto itself has no fees for buying/a unless you’re using your debit/ccard. However you need to learn the sale percentages of the coins. The price reflected on the graph daily is not the actual price. That’s the buy price. What I do is use the Binance app for the real price so that I’m not ticked off when I sell and find it’s $20 to sell when actually they’re reasonable. Setting up a bank account requires specific banks. Make sure yours is on the list. Once you get the hang of the fiat wallet and your buy/sale percentages it really is a great up. Set all your financial stuff up and get your bank account squared away before you buy anything. Get secure with how to get your money back into your pocket. Easy to use.

This is my first time buying crypto or any investments really, and dipping my toes in the pool of crypto currency through this app has been phenomenal! Although nothing is without its faults, I do have a bit of a problem with the notification system. I have multiple types of notifications set to go off if some cryptos hit different price point but they never go off. Even with notifications on in-app and in the settings on my phone.
I’ve missed out on some big opportunities because of this. I don’t want to have to move to another app to fix this issue so it’d be awesome if you couple help resolve it.

 P.S. It’d be awesome if you were to tweak the little colorful screen and sound it does when you successfully buy or trade by adding a little vibration.

1,"Pointless and pretty much useless. The spread is ridiculously wide; you’d end up losing 6 to 12 times the amount you would have paid for an average commission with other brokers per trade.  It doesn’t have Exchange, so you’re pretty much playing roulettes and hope your gains don’t end up getting spent on the spread when trading.  If the value of your coins drop in the middle of the night or when you’re away from your phone, good luck managing your losses.  The only possible way it could be useful is when you’re holding your coins long term, but then you’ll have to worry losing money on conversion and then fees transferring them out. I bet they make a ton of money with how wide the spread is and the difference in conversion. When you’re buying and selling, there are options to convert it to either CRO, USDM, or BTC.  I find the USDM to have smaller conversion difference but good luck with being consistent with choosing it. Those three options get shuffled all the time as if it is designed with the purpose of making you make mistake in choosing their own coin CRO.

Also when buying or selling you have to buy a minimum and when selling there is a minimum which then if you don’t have enough to sell what are you suppose to do? 
You also have to have a minimum to move off the exchange so the only option ends up buying more coins to sell or move! Such a scam. 
And lastly, when buying I notice the prices are higher than other exchanges and lower when selling! This company is ripping all of us off. Very annoyed and bought when I was newer into crypto and didn’t know better. Now I will definitely lose huge profits due to their company policies.

The market data is also not reliable by a long shot. The graphs never match the actual current prices, and is limited to only an 8 hour snap shot. No zooming in, or getting real time stats. They lure you in with free trades for a month, but after that there’s no way it’s worth paying this company to trade as they offer nothing credible to justify it. Their debit card options are based on their poorly earning in-house crypto that doesn’t hold much value at all. The kicker is that you have to stake a set amount of money to keep any rewards you would benefit from staking. Specially when you end up likely going broke keeping your money with them. 

If your looking for trading crypto look elsewhere. Even the limited options with Robin Hood and Webull still give far more in-depth stats with free trades. Be warned.",2021-04-25 10:23:20,AgentAbsurdia,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
5,"A MUST HAVE APP FOR CRYPTO!!!. This app and the organization is just amazing! It’s extremely user friendly, has a great look to it, and awesome staking options and interest rates. The customer service is outstanding! I’ve only had one issue with this app/company since I’ve started using it in March 2021. The issue was actually in their DeFi wallet app. The customer service rep I worked with in the chat had my problem resolved same day. They walked me through every step and were just amazing. They are always quick to respond too. 

I always recommend this app to everyone who asks me what apps to use or to people on social media asking which app to use. It’s just so easy to use and they have a wide variety of crypto coins to invest in. If you are considering this app, download it! You will be happy that you did.",2021-09-06 00:46:05,Xczsdfgty,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
3,"19, In college, and throughly enjoying this app, but definitely in need of improvements. Helps me invest equity with as much direct attention. Love the card, love the staking benefits, and crypto purchase without fees, but I would really appreciate a greater amount of CRO trading pairs and more advanced market orders. I feel like its one of the areas in which your app lags. I think level 2 market data should also be a consideration but primarily behind more advanced trading orders, the app really needs a refresher visually and with more chart options. I cant really trade when Im just looking at a line without a distinct time frame. You need candles and multipe time frames. take a page from webull or tradingviews book. When you dont give the customer complete control of the price and an inaccurate view of the price action, your zero fees dont matter because you more than likely profit off the difference of market orders and customer orders.",2021-08-06 23:46:53,Polygon.Stake,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"Fraud. At the highest levels. You are offered a $50 credit. Which you can not get until you put in $100. The value of the coin is minimal. It’s been 3 months and they still haven’t shipped my card. After 3 months of waiting now they want sensitive information such as a bank statement to verify my address when they already have my address. The staking feature is also misleading. It only gives you 2% back after you put in $1000s of dollars. Better off getting a citi card. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. They collect your very highly sensitive data and hold their free debt card hostage. There is no debt card. It should not take 3 months to ship a debt card. And the come back to say, we need to verify your address. Send us all your personal details. But before then they were stating that they haven’t shipped it due to Covid or a printing issue. You will see their BOT comment below stating to contact customer service. I did do this and the above is what was asked of me. Please do not download this. Use Coinbase or cash app. Not worth the headache.",2020-11-17 08:54:31,Chaloops,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,RIPPERS!!!. This app is another measure of ripping people off their hard earned money without considering we are all in a pandemic. I put money on this app from my bank and traded with crypto so it could have gains. As soon the I noticed the market rise and tried to withdrew my gains this app never allowed me to. They requested for a document and after providing it they request for an alternative document and keep requesting. Worst part is their contact support always tells you there is nothing they can do and they ca not share information with you so you have both the account and your money including the gains all gone. They will not allow you to resolve a dispute but always looking for ways to block your account and take your money referring you to their terms and condition that says they can go away with your money if you have issues with your account. This app is shady. Very shady!!! Please take this app down because they are very unprofessional at dealing with dispute and always want to close your money with the account.,2022-02-03 15:39:34,Mattnat5960,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"Absolute worst app ever. Trust me do not use this app for your crypto purchases, when trying to buy crypto it always says error occurred and the price of the crypto has changed, then you try and try again only to find out it charged you for every single time you tried and it didn’t even give me the extra coins, on top of that it’s impossible to get ahold of customer support to help fix the problem, then if that wasn’t bad enough, when you cash out they use plaid, which isn’t terrible but they make it like pulling teeth to get your money, then if that wasn’t bad enough it says 3-5 days to get your money, it’s been weeks before where I had to send a contact support email to the company and wait an additional week just to get a response to get my money. Trust me use another platform, I went to coinbase after this experience and it has been flawless, and customer support are actually American English speaking people and not some middle eastern person who is impossible to get anything done with.",2021-11-27 18:38:01,MTG EBAY TOP SELLER,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"The plot thickens…. After hunting the Internet for a telephone number for crypto’s customer support or anyone for that matter, I found the same number that lead to a 405 Burbank California number that no one answered five minutes later while I was on the phone theyCalled 10 times consecutively without leaving a message. When I called them back it was crypto or so I thought. This is no insult to Indian people whatsoever I am brown as well however it is very well known that India is the epicenter for Internet scams and credit card fraud companies. An Indian man stating he was from California but he could not describe Burbank to me, insisted on continuing to ask me for information but could not remedy my issues of validation on the website. You must validate through an email to have the software run correctly. It has not for me at all and I never received an email and the software is telling me that I am out of my region which I am not.

First of all, if you haven’t used Binance yet make sure to enter the reward coupon MTPDHCLV on the sign up screen to get 40% commission kickback rate. Wonderful... The best trading app ever. Very fast and reliable. God! Your app rock. I mean no change for trading and you can trade so many coin at the same time. Wow! With every update from past 4-5 months, the app has just got sleeker and sleeker. Both buy and sell interface are now on same page to make things more eaiser i recommend this app. The fees are reasonable if you use BNB to cover your fees for trading, Binance cuts fees down 50% if you use BNB, the fees go down more depending on what ""tier"" or level user you are. Pricing is real time, sending and receiving crypto is quick. Their security is incredible, the level of security used to protect the user account is one of the best. They now offer a virtual wallet, and the support team is quick to help if you need them. One recommendations - In trades (center) tab when we click on the open trades icon, the history is out at the top right which isn't quite an ideal position. Do what you've done for futures open orders and order history, just slide right to get the order history. That would be really neat... All bug with new upload are fixed!! Great!!",2022-09-19 07:10:40,07mt3724,Binance,Apple App Store,us
5,"Top app!!!. This app is one of the largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges which popular crypto exchange services. 

if you haven’t used yet make sure to enter the reward coupon PPV2MWAA on the sign up screen to get 40% commission kickback rate. 

Standard Binance trading fees are 0.1%, but by using Binance native token BNB, you can make considerable reduction to the fees, currently 25% less if yo the option to pay fees in BNB (instead of paying them in the coin you are buying). 

There is no buying limit if you want to do crypto to crypto transactions. There is a withdrawal limit of 2 BTC for unverified accounts which gets lifted once you go through KYC procedure. They use service called Simplex to execute these orders. Simplex charges 3.5 percent of a transaction with a $10 minimum (flat fee). The daily limit is $20,000 per user, while the monthly max is $50,000 per user. Since Binance main platform used to be crypto only where you could do deposits in any of the 150+ supported coins. Same goes for withdrawals – you just need the address on blockchain of the coin you want to withdraw. 

Nowadays, Binance supports fiat deposits as well so you can buy bitcoin with credit/debit cards. In some countries, Binance supports a direct wire transfer as a deposit method as well.",2022-09-29 01:23:01,Drop John JB,Binance,Apple App Store,us
4,"Best binance wonderful app review. Today Bitcoin is more than just an asset, Bitcoin has been 100x better investment than anything else in the past 10 years, you can Google it yourself. Bitcoin is both a currency and technology, and only a few people understand how to maximize profits and huge returns in a short period of time. I was fortunate to meet Expert Donaldcyberlord and cryptocurrency expert on a Bitcoin blog online. I contacted him for guidance, we talked for a while and I did subscribe to their bitcoin investment/mining program, believe it or not he made me $490,050 in just 6 weeks and I was very much impressed at his skills, and I only started with a small amount. Before I met him, I was a bit careless with security features strong passwords earlier when I started up on Coinbase and was hacked with almost 8 bitcoin stolen from my wallet, when I told him about it, he just requested for details of hacked transaction in my wallet and all transaction details, he traced the hackers wallet addresses they moved my coins to and extracted all my coins back from the blockchain network in just 48 hours. I had a bet with him that if he could truly get back my coins I would let the world know about him. You can drop him a mail at, Donaldcyberlord@Gmail. Com",2022-07-24 19:27:27,Robert.

1,Seriously do not get this app!!!. So I had binance for a couple months now and I thought it was a pretty chill app. Around a month ago I decided I wanted to switch my Bitcoin to another app and I think I only had $20 worth of Bitcoin. It wouldn’t let me even consider taking it out until I had a certain amount which in my case was $50 worth. I’m not even mad mad at that part the part that’s making me mad is the fact that first I put the bitcoin into usd so I could take it out and put it in my bank. Everytime I try it even tho it literally has my number for verification it keeps saying they sent a link to my email. I check my email there is no link!!!! I check my junk everything no link is being sent. And I tried that around 5 times. I send a “ticket” out which is supposed to tell them the problem your having. Probably like 2 weeks later I’m like smh so I decide to put it back into Bitcoin and just deposit the bitcoin into my other crypto app and it pretty much does the same thing. It claims it’s sending an email with a link but I’m getting mo link. Long story short my 50$ is stuck in there and I have no way of getting it out. I sent multiple tickets no one has gotten back to me so I thought I’d make this review because this type of thing happens with this app I did look it up and saw it happened to a couple ppl. Some figured it out but some couldn’t.,2022-03-24 17:26:36,Bluesnow1111,Binance,Apple App Store,us
4,"Binance Best app with Extraordinary service. Loosing ones Crypto currency can be a devastating thing to experience, the fact that it is almost impossible to recover a Stolen or lost Crypto coin hurt more than anything. When a person get scammed of their money while investing in a crypto currency platform the only thing they can think of is how to report the company and get back their money. Most victims of the scam contact their wallet account provider, their bank or the law enforcement, a few end up hiring a lawyer to sue the company but after all these stress they still cant get their money back. Please everyone should be careful where they invest their money. Bitcoin has made many rich and at the same time made so many broke and desperate. Few weeks ago when I was referred to Spycjonnes and I was able to get back all my dogecoin that was Stolen through their services.

2,"Don’t waste your time.. The only thing good about the app is it’s interface. If I didn’t have this one problem I would be obsessed with the app. The customer support is basically non existent. You have to submit a ticket if you have an issue, but don’t express a response. I’ve attempted over 300 times to purchase crypto directly and deposit money to my account, and only TWO times did I find success. I was allowed two times to purchase crypto directly from my linked bank account. I’ve deleted and add my bank 100 times, that doesn’t work. I’ve submitted multiple tickets. No response. I’m transferring the very little crypto I was allowed to purchase to a wallet and I’m switching over to another app.

It’s very upsetting because the app offers a variety of crypto and low fees. The only thing I can’t do is purchase the crypto. It seems like a lot of people have this problem so I wonder how they even make money.

To top it off they do not have a phone number to talk to an actually person, if you use the app and have this same issue, I’d advise not to call any of the number google or the random websites say is Binance’s phone number they’re obvious scams.

1,"Be careful, you could loose your investment. When markets move in a favorable direction many users reported their accounts locked. Check Twitter for details of customers begging to get their accounts unlocked. I’ve been a Binance customer since 2017, already authenticated, and verified multiple times. My account was locked  from February through May 2021 on both Binance and Binance US. Magically, my accounts were unlocked after market took a steep dive. Binance, virtually offers no customer support, no phone to call, no follow up email. You will only get an acknowledgment email to confirm that customer support received your complaints.  I tried hundreds of times without a response. I moved to my accounts their main competitor. FTC needs to jump in and regulate.

Check the reviews, too many users have similar experience. Binance uses our Crypto to trade for their own benefit, could explain locked accounts. Cheats. Doesn’t make sense this app received more than 2 stars review.",2021-06-17 03:22:32,Tammmmmmz,Binance,Apple App Store,us
4,"Cluttered GUI. The exchanges GUI is cluttered. I end up touching something I didn’t mean to touch because all the buttons are close to each other. I understand they want this to be user friendly by placing everything in the open so nothing is hidden but it just makes everything messy. Add menus and you can free up space on the GUI. It’s hard increasing and decreasing price of coins we are selling in the exchange without hitting something else and causing the screen to swipe. Same goes for the amount buttons to increase and decrease the amount of coins we are selling and buying in the exchange screen. 

Also id like to be able to see market/price history on the buy/sell screen so I can see how much a coin was being sold for last month as I’m pricing it for selling without having to change screens and go to the other market tab to engage prices. 

Oh and most importantly there should be a note when selling coins that there’s a bare minimum of .1 before we go to sell our coins. I wasted time setting up a coin to sell just to find out afterwards I didn’t have enough coins to sell which wasted minutes of my time. So minimums and other rules should be made visible at all times. 

Other than that it’s a good app. 4 stars.",2020-06-07 21:21:03,cmj141,Binance,Apple App Store,us
3,"Mobile application trend lines changes. Unfortunately the mobile app has recently changed regarding the drawing of trend lines. This app was absolutely fantastic to draw trends, change past drawn lines and being able to see approximately the date of intersecting trends. There was no announcement of the update/changes and I want Binance to read this feedback so as to change things back to what they were. The app was a well deserved 5 star rating but now it is not as helpful as it was. 
Even on stochastic indicators, trend lines and cursor could be dragged over to see values of RSI, KDJ and so on easily, user-friendly like no other app. 

Kindly correct this easy step to assist the functionality of your trading app and provide your customers with an experience that can’t be beaten by your competitors. Thank you",2021-11-16 14:47:55,Jay T 2402,Binance,Apple App Store,us

However, a couple updates back i noticed a sudden change in performance when you enter trade charts, open the buy/sell menu, and leave trading charts in particular where the app consistently stalls for a one or two second period before the action is carried out. This used to not happen and makes it difficult to quickly switch between trades and buy or sell on mobile. These used to happen almost instantly. It would be really helpful if this delay could be sorted out.

1,"One of the most useless crypto app ever. Cryptocurrencies might be Binance’s game, they might actually be fairly good at it (have yet to get hacked to the point of shutting down; owner have not run off with investors crypto assets). But the entire registration and verification process is broken as F___! And from the family and friends that told me their personal experiences about Binance, I can keep trying (to infinity) or give up.  Binance is that bad, at least with ID verification and proof of address, etc.  the advice is to keep trying, uploading the same PDF document and with any luck, 6 months later, it will magically get approved.

I supposed it could be a Robinhood app, and Binance will disrupt trading, force liquidate positions, just because they are undercapitalized and think they can do it without legal and civil ramifications. 

Oh, the Binance mobile app and their website can’t agree on my login credentials either. At first I thought I downloaded the wrong app and my login is actually being sent to the database of a phishing con artist. Luckily it is just horrible UI, flawed end user usability issue, that even a novice Software QA tester can identify and document for a high priority bug fix report.

Well now that CZ is kicking us off after giving in to supporting all that goes against crypto, I no longer can use it even with a VPN. 

So I temporarily went over to Binance U.S. but they stole $50,000 from me the first month I was there a year ago and never gave it back because they messed up my KYC. 

They stole $96,000 from another friend that nearly bankrupt him right when he had his first child.

They stole around $20k from another friend who attempted to self harm himself when he couldn’t get help to get his life savings back. 

It’s wrong. 

Then CZ allows Brian Brooks, a criminal, to run Binance U.S. like this with no customer service or care for people’s lives.

They deduct 1000$ from me without getting the relevant cryto currency. If you have an alternative, use it and don’t use This app!",2021-04-16 23:48:38,Mohamed Al-Rasheed,Binance,Apple App Store,us

5,"Best kucoin wonderful app review. Today Bitcoin is more than just an asset, Bitcoin has been 100x better investment than anything else in the past 10 years, you can Google it yourself. Bitcoin is both a currency and technology, and only a few people understand how to maximize profits and huge returns in a short period of time. I was fortunate to meet Expert Donaldcyberlord and cryptocurrency expert on a Bitcoin blog online. I contacted him for guidance, we talked for a while and I did subscribe to their bitcoin investment/mining program, believe it or not he made me $490,050 in just 6 weeks and I was very much impressed at his skills, and I only started with a small amount. Before I met him, I was a bit careless with security features strong passwords earlier when I started up on Coinbase and was hacked with almost 8 bitcoin stolen from my wallet, when I told him about it, he just requested for details of hacked transaction in my wallet and all transaction details, he traced the hackers wallet addresses they moved my coins to and extracted all my coins back from the blockchain network in just 48 hours. I had a bet with him that if he could truly get back my coins I would let the world know about him. You can drop him a mail at, cryptoshades@Gmail.

5,"Best in the biz (US available). Been on this exchange for almost 8 months and it’s come a long way. The ONLY major exchange I have found, available for use in the US, to offer derivatives (long/short w/ leverage) and a plethora of leveraged swaps. They have FREE TO USE, IN EXCHANGE trading bots!!!! no API keys or suspect integration. Very easy to set up, and you can have 10 running simultaneously. Not to mention the Staking options have grown a bunch just in the past few months alone. I’ve been hounding the team to develop a desktop app, but I mainly use the web client as a 32’ screen is a lil easier to view charts on, as opposed to a phone😂 A few things I would like to see: - We need order-triggers-order and order-cancels-order options for trading and futures! - Make a desktop app! - The ability to do derivative future strategies (like a straddle or straggle) would also be amazing considering arbitrage portfolios are a thing now. You can currently run a bot straddle strategy, but its not quite the same! Overall, 9.5/10 UI is gorgeous and night mode rocks Coin variety is top notch Want to go short?

I had lost over $1000 due to google two FA it was unbearable for weeks trying to get approved to unbind Google two FA and I was getting very frustrated so I left a extremely negative review and KuCoin even though their platform is amazing and they have some of the best crypto to trade early. I thought what’s the use if I can’t even trade my money or my crypto well here’s a little note for anybody this happens to, it’s not KU coins fault, first off when you go to do your identity in your photos remember if you’re using an iPhone it’s not shooting in JPEG unless you go change it on your settings, JPEG is the format that your photo ID documents need to be in for KU coin to use to unbind Google 2FA! Thank you KU coin for being honest for emailing me for telling me that you found my crypto, for telling me that it was safe, and for telling me that I could do it myself all I had to do was read a little bit more and I did and I figured it out, so if this is happened to you don’t give up on KU coin learn and then learn some more you’ll be just fine!",2021-12-31 14:42:13,SWIFT MELLO,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us
1,"Worst app ever. I downloaded this app after a friend recommended it little did I know how much of a mistake that was. I put in $50 to try it out and play around, when I decided this was possibly the worst app to ever be developed I tried to withdraw it I’m hit with a $30 fee, so I decided I would rather not as I don’t believe these fools who call themselves developers deserve 30 dollars but I pushed through the hard and difficult times with the app and started to make some money, well today I had placed a future with most of the money I had in there and had set a stop loss for 5%, I got a little worried when I could see that the stop loss should’ve kicked in and it hadn’t, so I tried to login but alas the faulty and horrendous app Dosent let me, gives me errors and tells me I have no positions open and that there’s no data but when I close the app and open again I can see the charts and price of the coin but when I try login my connection just magically Dosent work, my position was eventually liquidated after I gave up trying to login and as soon as it did I could login with no errors and problems at all.

A LOT of money can be made using it, and the KCS coin is a great utility token you can earn while just holding a few. If you are in the U.S. just do what they ask of the KYC docs KuCoin requests you to do, you will still be able to use the exchange regardless, the main thing is only transfer in stable coins (USDT, USDC, UST) don’t go adding your debit card number or any of that. Do not listen to the FUD you read here in the reviews, yes they were hacked back in 2020, but have since remitted every penny and then some with insurance and restitution money. Not only that, they’re security has become 10 fold stronger since the incident. It has leverage on all the best coin PERPs, though I highly recommend getting used to the app first.

2,Bad customer service and non functional app. Are usually use Bybit but I decided to start using KuCoin seem like a better app in trading platform so I went ahead and deposited money and started using some bots problem is the one bought you can only use on the mobile app so for some odd reason it worked on the mobile app so after I set everything up everything was working fine and then a day later I go to check and it will not let me get into the bot won’t let me send feedback Customer Service is almost non-supportive and they keep telling me to update to newer version 3.49.1 but there’s inly 3.49.0 in AppStore there is now 3.50.0 which still has done nothing to solve the problem they also said turn off your phone and reinstall app which I did and check vpn. I did everything they said to do and it still does not work I still can’t check my bot keeps saying timed out . I can’t even send feedback won’t let me and customer service takes forever.  Good thing I didn’t transfer 100k over and put in to mobile bot. Wish someone would help.  I liked the app at first but now not so much,2022-02-13 18:29:44,BD9,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us
1,"Trading on this app is a scam. I consider myself an avid trader who knows what they’re doing. But Kucoin will destroy any hope you have. When trading futures, it feels like my trades specifically are picked and wiped out and then immediately trend the direction I bet on. When I place a limit order, I can see the price start to fluctuate as soon as I type an order that would be fulfilled in my favor. I have placed opposite sided trades on a second device and BOTH sides were SHORTED on a volume of maybe 100 coins of a sub dollar coin within 15 minutes. I have screen recorded trading showing how the app practically tracks my inputs since they also know my exact percentages and what it would take to wipe out a trade. The trading bot is also worthless. You pay more in GRID gains than you make no matter how you set it up, and the bots also contribute to the problem with futures. 

Stay away from this horrible trading app. You can only make money holding (unless they take your coin off the market then your holdings are gone too), which I also bet they use to manipulate prices when you’re not using. That’s what staking off chain is as well, hence the lower apr you get.",2021-02-10 12:30:28,AndrewLeeWoolard,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us
5,"This app really needs fixing. I have loved using futures until here recently, I buy in at a certain price look down and the market price puts me down 5-10 dollars already. I’ve also recently bought deduction coupons and have yet to see fees be 100% deducted it truly makes no sense. I also set a stop loss and it doesn’t trigger until the actual price gets there but market price will be 10 or more dollars passed that so instead of the price I actually selected to lose I lose way more than I actually wanted to which is absolutely stupid and a scam!

**update** still no progress. We’re 4 months and counting and still haven’t been able to get my money. One would figure they pick up the phone and call. Nope, they take weeks to respond via email and come up with new reasons to not allow me to use my money. Please be aware as this isn’t getting any better and hope you don’t lose money.

4,"Severe concerns. I’ve loved this app since day one. I’ve been using it a long time and they have made thousands off of me. 
But Kucoin is beginning to severely worry me. This is a trading app, not a HODLing app. 
Therefor you need to be able to trade. Kucoin has started crashing at very crucial times. I lost over 30% of my portfolio because I tried to initiate a sell and Kucoin’s network went down for the 6th time that week because it got a little busy and had to do it’s job a little harder. poof. gone.  6 months of savings and trading gone in 20 minutes, not from a bad trade. It was an excellent trade. Kucoin just couldn’t follow-through. 
People are putting their faith in crypto currency because they are sick of banks and conglomerates incompetence and greed losing their money for them. I’m those 20 minutes. Everything is up to date. Kucoin simply is failing when it gets busy and people are losing 10s of thousands as a result. 
Kucoin- fix your problems immediately.
 some of us work in journalism and will end this apps American base faster than you can can “network error :)”
I’ll need to see consistent improvements and hopefully some kind of statement from Kucoin about the problems soon or I’m out and am ensuring  as many people as possible are aware of it",2021-10-15 23:49:37,theguyyoucanthatebecausevirtue,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us
1,"Terrible experience. I felt the need to write my first ever review on the Apple App Store for this. I downloaded this app to use future trading. The app freezes up and will not allow me to execute a trade on several occasions.  Ironically it seems to have these “glitches” whenever I am up profit on an asset. The app will not allow Me to execute a trade claiming “network” issues and forcing me to hold my position while all the profits deplete and actually fall into the negative mark before finally allowing me to trade. These experiences have left a terrible taste in my mouth and I can’t help but think the creators are pulling a fast one. I have lost over $3,000 because of my experiences using this application. (All of my other trading platforms would work perfectly during these described issues and I was able to execute perfect trades on every other platform I utilize) so they cannot claim it is my own personal network.

But could improve on (SPEED) and remove 3 second ads when opening the app. And mainly please add (% CHANGE )on the coins holding and portfolio so it could be seen it quickly, and in order when scrolling through the holdings. Instead of opening each coin and pair to see daily % change.

Also when using futures, it’s takes a while to submits orders, and sometimes the position disappears for few seconds until close out the app or refresh. 
And seems when placing a market buy or sell, it always executed at the highest price or lowest prices then jumps back to the price not in your favor.",2022-05-20 05:05:17,Tarkkus,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us

I’ve been trading stocks for a while now, so I signed up for KuCoin thinking ‘how hard can it possibly be?’ Well, they’ve made me cry ‘Uncle!’ This is the most confusing interface I’ve ever seen in my life. I wanted to use this exchange because they do have a huge number of coins to trade. I think I’m going to withdraw my funds and go back to the main coins and forget it, though. It doesn’t help that it takes a really long time for a deposit to go from your checking account, through Banxa or Simplex, and arrive in your trading account. While you’re thinking ‘OK, where the heck is my money?!’ (It’s been over an hour since I KNEW where that 10k was.) and, of course, ‘customer service’ is basically an FAQ Bot.

BUT there has been numerous situations including the most recent leading me to leave a negative review. KuCoin buy/sell/market orders will sometimes not complete or go through. This requires you to refresh the app, wasting time in between your trades. What is the point of trading on an app where I have to refresh one to several times before I can make my trade. Lost thousands from this issue I am describing, and each time it pushes me closer towards finding an alternative exchange that doesn’t require manual refreshing while trading positions. There are lots of bots and manipulation within this app, and I’m growing more weary of it by the day.

1- customer support… it is very hard to get thru and get a prompt reply
2- fiat … if there’s a way KuCoin can set up the ability to accept fiat currency without the confusing and expensive option they recently added this would bring more users to the platform 
3- on chain debit card … if they would institute one of these like some exchanges have done this is another thing would greatly expand their membership",2022-02-06 20:18:10,Efilnikufecinjb,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us

I have no idea what this trading password is (i never made one) and when I ask them to reset it, they don’t accept the photos and information that they require to verify my account. They continue to tell me the reset attempt failed and then ask me to resubmit the info. Beyond frustrated.

1,"Don’t use. Kucoin needs to get shut down by some agency in the US.. everything is done to get you liquidated. My 20x future was liquidated when the market dropped 2.4%… if you do the math, my position should not have been liquidated. It wasn’t due to “spread”. From my average cost to the lowest low on the futures pair, it should have never been liquidated (20x on -2.4% from average cost does not equal 100%). It is about time somebody goes after Kucoin in the US.

This has been a problem for me the whole time using Kucoin. Lost tens of thousands because of this and their “random” log out event that occurs when market tanks. They log you out completely randomly, often. It prevents you from logging in. No SMS sent to log in. If you have positions open you will not be able to get to them.

1,"Terrible support.  Tried very hard and didn’t want to leave.. I signed up and all seemed okay.   I was cruising along buying this and that.   Used the same funding account every time to load USDT.  (Speaking of USDT when I was referred as a new user, I tried to get the sign up bonus but their wording is/was purposely confusing.   I say purposely because I pointed out the grammatical errors and they just ignored me)

Anyway… yeah at first I was having to pay exorbitant fees to load USDT via 3rd party, then they finally verified me and it was 1.02 which was nice.

Then, out of the blue, I go to load $200 via same payment source as before, at same internet IP I always use, and it says “for your safety your trade has been canceled”.  I ask support and they say try a new bank card.   Grrr.   Went to my bank and got a new card.  And voila!! It still does the same thing.   And here I am 2 weeks and several closed tickets later.

1,"Absolute thieves. I’m finally in contact with a group of investors to help bring to light the unethical practices of KuCoin. As an avid trader, I was excited and eager to utilize KuCoin due to their wide array of token offerings and an involved CEO. However, after a few questionable losses, I began having my suspicions about them. Low and behold, they’ve failed to address major “flaws” and are greatly profiting by liquidations. Customer service only responds with generic emails as though I’m an inexperienced trader. However, this is completely the opposite of such. I’m well aware of how this should work on an ethical platform. There’s plenty of articles finally exposing exactly how and what they are doing and can be found on Reddit in the subreddit labeled “Cryptocurrency.” 

Do NOT leave your money with these thieves.",2021-12-30 13:47:27,mdsnrn,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us

Only thing I can gripe about is.. that it was pretty difficult to learn how to use the app. But after messing around and learning to I became a pro. They have future trading which is definitely a plus. Tips for loading money: use an exchange you can buy crypto on like coinbase or crypto . Com and do a wallet to wallet transfer.

1,"Only freezes. Dangerous exchange. I’m on about 15-20 different exchanges and never seen anything freeze like Kucoin does. How on earth do they have the conscience to even charge trading fees when they make you lose your whole portfolio. Their infrastructure is out of date, and their chart freezes every hour making you think it’s one price and it’s another. Refreshing doesn’t help. This isn’t once or twice. This is every day multiple times a day. The concept of the exchange is awesome, and Kucoin could have the world with their good customer service, but until they fix the most vital issue any exchange can have, it’s dangerous to trade on here so stay away.

1,"Dated UI, Poor performing API, WILL NOT EXECUTE MANUAL CLOSES.. KuMex is feels years behind other exchanges, like other new exchanges, in terms of UI and API. The Stop Losses and Take Profits can’t be set on mobile when making an order. Stop Losses will randomly disappear (they claim it’s from modified a Stop Loss.. then why did the new stop loss disappear as well?).

The biggest issue with their service is the manual close on KuMex. If you attempt a market close under critical conditions if a stop loss isn’t met or “changed” the market close MAY not work in order to sever losses and avoid a liquidation. This market is dangerous and any violent movement, like on 3/13, that causes issues with the exchange can cause the UI market close to not execute.

When I sold, the price was back to 13 cents. All my money gone.

5,Easy crypto purchasing. I was looking for a good platform to buy coins and discovered Ownr wallet. In fact it's more than a wallet. I use it mostly to buy crypto when i need it fast.,2021-10-20 13:12:39,takefiery,OWNR Digital Wallet,Apple App Store,us

1,Not functioning as intended.. I can’t complete any verification on this app since it won’t sent out codes. Tried with several numbers. All of which are actual phone lines and not voip but still nothing. I transferred in some doge coin but now I can’t do anything with it including transfer out. It’s more like a vault. A vault you will never have access to than a wallet.,2022-09-25 23:41:41,JustRickyJoe,OWNR Digital Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"Do NOT use this wallet!. Both my friend and I had severe issues with withdrawing our Bitcoin. When I complained about my account to Technical support, they said it was a technical error with my account that has never happened before. They told me they would “fix it” and they did. 

Against my better judgement, I didn’t delete the app and continued to use it. Now I’m having trouble withdrawing my Bitcoin again. I’ve complained to technical support once again but they haven’t done anything about it yet. 

I believe it’s just a way for them to prevent people from withdrawing their Bitcoin. 

DO NOT USE THIS APP

Use something more well known like exodus",2021-04-02 17:56:30,shamemaker,OWNR Digital Wallet,Apple App Store,us

5,"Amazing app for beginners. Enter Referral ID when registering: IM4LWDAV to get diamonds for NFT! The best cryptocurrency app! Very user-friendly interface, there are absolutely all the coins, you can collect and monitor your portfolio. Very powerful functionality for conducting cryptocurrency market analytics. It is also convenient to add coins to metamask. A useful and interesting news section. I love everything about this app. Hopefully soon they will make their own exchange and then there will be no need for competitors! I'm still waiting for the rating of IDO sites, this is sorely lacking in the application and on the site. Competitors have such functionality, but they are not convenient. I would like all this to be in your application. Please also integrate portfolios via API from various exchanges. This functionality is very useful for analyzing your portfolio. Really best app for tracking portfolio but really needs an option to swipe and remove coins as seems to go all sorts of weird if a coin gets delisted and no way to click edit and remove when this happens. Btw I’m using an updated iPhone if devs are wondering. Would update to 5 stars if it actually worked because it WAS useful  The developers are great! I want to express my deepest gratitude and respect to them for this application! Thank you very much!",2021-12-06 16:11:08,Pol Ji,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
5,"It Is Perfect Again. I wrote the below b/c I cldn’t get it to work. Apparently, after updates, we shld log out and log back in, and that will fix all of these issues. If u hv the same or similar problems, keep this in mind. 😁 Lost out on an NFT drop b/c of this. My own fault. If I’d tried the standard things like logging out/back in, probably cld hv saved myself the headache. Live & learn.

“Until about 2 weeks ago, this app worked perfectly! I used it on my computer and on my Apple phone. About 2 weeks ago, it began having issues. It won’t stay logged in when I go to get my daily diamonds. I hv to log in 3 times in a row to get it to give them to me. When I try to add new purchased crypto to my page, it says I don’t hv any and won’t let me log in. However, when I open the app, I hv it set to the ‘Current Balance’ tab, and it loads just fine, showing all my current holdings. It’s very confusing. I tried deleting the app and reloading it. It did the same thing to me. If you can fix all of this, it wld be perfect again.”",2021-12-10 20:42:52,Filer1,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
2,"Worst Update Ever!. While there are a few additions to this new update that were good (keeping track of price per coin and transaction fees), the app now glitches more than ever. Totals, coin prices, and charts will not refresh half the time. Also, the app freezes up when trying to enter additions and subtractions to my positions. I find myself having to force quit the app many times just to enter staking interest for a few coins. Sometimes the app just doesn’t work at all in the portfolio section, no matter how many times I try to refresh or relaunch the app. Also, in the portfolio section, we use to have the ability to pull up charts for individual coins, but now we have to go to another section to do that. Also, on the front page, I’ve found that “Global Overview” seems to randomly pop up at times and I have no idea how to do it when I want to see it. It just randomly appears sometimes. Also, the profiles for individual coins really need to be updated. There are plenty of coins still listed as being on exchanges that they’ve been delisted from, others not being listed as being on exchanges that I’ve recently purchased them on, and many coins where there are no news entries for the past few years even though I can find plenty of articles if I do a Google search. This app needs more stability and a comprehensive update to the content of the coin profiles.",2021-01-16 01:03:18,Mr. Willcott,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
5,"Useful but one of the most frustrating apps. This app worked amazing and was very useful until 2 updates ago….after the second to last update my watch lists stopped showing up correctly. Only some coins show up in my watch lists. It says 14 are in the list but only one show up and I can’t add them back again. Figured maybe it was a glitchy update so I just waited for the next one but I just updated it again and it’s still like that. Makes the app useless to keep my lists, so frustrating because it was a very useful app when it worked. Btw I’m using an updated iPhone if devs are wondering. Would update to 5 stars if it actually worked because it WAS useful

 Edit: just uninstalled and redownloaded after the most recent update and it’s working again. Didn’t work last time so I guess the update did fix it. Back to 5 stars the app is useful",2021-07-10 08:30:44,iphoneuser44444444,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
5,Must Have App. This is a must have app for any person interested in learning about or investing in crypto.  It allows you to track your own portfolio investments in a comprehensive way that no exchange does.  Mind you it may take some time for you to enter your current investments. however it will be more than worth the time when you are able to track your percentage allocations and also track your winners and losers. this information is not calculated on your basic wallet or your exchanges. in addition the news and announcements that are provided for your selected crypto allows you to DYOR. In short this app is an absolutely must have for anyone who wishes to dabble in crypto currencies or engage FOMO or YOLO investing.  lol,2021-06-13 12:33:39,Craig Barrett,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
4,"Changes, some good, some bad. Hi! Overall I enjoy this application. It allows me to track my purchases across platforms I may have bought from using the PORTFOLIO tab. Nevertheless, I see that some changes have been made to this page. 

I like privacy mode. That’s a nice option. Nevertheless, when I used to press on the percentage button at the top right corner, I would get a DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR increase or decrease view, telling me exactly how much money I lost or gained. I see that the total money lost or gained has moved out of that box to right below the total asset number. However, it has completely left the individual assets. Meaning, when I pressed on the total percentage at the top right, I would get “dollar mode” where I can scrolll down and see how much I gained or lost per asset. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE. Please bring this back!! So disappointed I updated. Please please bring this back.",2021-01-12 16:23:43,Pizzahatyou,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
3,"Gets the job done.. This website is amazing because of all the great assets it has and etc. The app works great as well. One can easily look up a coin or token and check its current price and daily gain/loss percentage. On the other hand, this has 3 stars because there are many apps like this, that even allow people to do more. With this said, a few things should be considered.

1. Being able to set alerts for cryptos on your watchlist, so if say Adshares surpasses 50¢ it will send a notification. Or if a coin on a watchlist has dropped or gained a certain percentage.

2. Add a widget. So certain coins or tokens on a watchlist could be easily looked at from the iPhone home screen, like CoinBase’s widget.

3. Donation option through the app via crypto, PayPal, or IAP. Maybe even purchasing something that gets rid of the small banner ad at the bottom of the app.

4. Looking at social media/reddit posts about the crypto through an embedded WebKit. You already have something sort of like this on your website. Just allow users to go to a “social media view” or something where they can see updates from the crypto company or about the crypto.

This app has fabulous potential, and this website is one of the best to look at crypto stats with. Keep up the good work! Hope this review helps! Thank you for reading this.",2018-06-12 06:08:35,ChrisCrutts,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
4,Great app 1 thing. I’m not getting my price alerts at all I got one since I have set like a bunch!?!?But besides that it’s a great app and I would recommend it to anyone that isn’t into crypto because you can sit proselytes on by her sale it has many different functions and it is a wonderful out playing and simple I just for some reason haven’t got none of my process lights but one since I said them and I know that there’s been more than once that some of my crypto’s I’m watching and have stock in has dropped below my price point and I never got are you single notification maybe it was my phone maybe it was just this one time I don’t know but might want to check on that but besides that great app keep it up and love what y’all are doing!!!,2021-10-27 13:53:19,webbtnvfl1,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
5,"Easily the cleanest/stable crypto app you will ever come across.. What an app. What a team behind the app. I use binance for trading and I hate their UI. It’s so raw and in your face. So I came across CoinMarketCap(recommended by my elder brother)
The moment I opened the app I fell in love because of the minimalistic style. There was a problem though, after a few seconds the app would say network timed out.
I reported the issue and was responded to by their development team promptly and they got the issue fixed. This app has helped me enjoy making tons of $$$ even more! Highly recommend: if you are into crypto, like making money, enjoy using a clean UI",2021-09-17 01:52:58,surreal730,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
1,"So frustrating.. A few versions ago, you were able to see your gains for different periods of time (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, etc). It would calculate how much profit or loss you had accumulated over that time. 

Now, you cannot see any of those calculations other than 24 hour profit or loss. When you switch views to the 7 day chart or 30 day chart, the profit or loss only shows you the 24 hour value. It’s absolutely maddening. Even the list of coins, there percent of appreciation/depreciation of stuck on the 24 hour value, so I can’t see how much Bitcoin or eth have appreciated over a week or a month, only 24 hours. 

I reached out to the company and they said this was by design. What?!? Really?! In my opinion they took away one of the most useful aspects of this app. I am now looking for a replacement app as I have waited through 3 or 4 updates for them to bring it back and they haven’t.",2021-09-05 11:31:19,Kks1030,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
3,"OK but lacks functionality. I downloaded this app hoping that it would provide similar features of their site, however it’s quite lacking even for a first edition. First off, there is no iPhone X display compatibility so the app size is the old style if used on it. Furthermore, you cannot drill down into each coin to see further stats on them. The app seems more for just quick viewing of prices, but there are better apps at the moment that accomplishes this and provides a significant more amount of information at the touch of a finger. Lastly, the drop down at the top that’s supposed to show 24hr volume, btc dominance, etc shows “?” for each stat.

As the market of such apps is quite extensive these days, I’d recommend looking elsewhere (CoinCap is much better currently) until CoinMarketCap decides to put more effort into theirs.",2018-05-02 23:20:05,thesourc3,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
5,"Truly a Amazing App for Beginners. I have been learning this past year about crypto’s, NFT’s, etc and I finally had the confidence to buy in and take a small risk. Not gonna give you some NBA career story, I didn’t do much. But I can say without hesitation I love this app. It’s easy to use design, no ads in sight, dark mode, all 3 of the major markets, and for me personally the ability to seamlessly switch between phone and pc really takes the cake. Overall 5/5 Great app! Would love to see a Apple Watch feature where I could just quickly check my portfolio though!",2022-01-16 16:42:41,Cooltuber101,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
4,"Convenient, But Noisy.. The app allows convenient access for looking up coins and tokens, getting their websites, and contract addresses. Unfortunately it gives automatic alerts for every coin / token in a watchlist with no option to disable it. And if you have a few lists that can result in getting alerts all day long. The only solution is to disable alerts entirely, or not use watch lists for organizing items you want to monitor or share. In case of the former, it results in not being able to use actual price alerts set. I’ll keep the app because of its convenience, but alerts will stay disabled and I’ll have to enable the specific price movements in another app.",2021-05-04 00:00:29,Prasand J,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
1,Terrible changes. So the “simpler and more friendly UI layout” is a complete lie and a massive step in the wrong direction. This is another example of a company having too many employees with nothing to do so they are told to make completely useless and unnecessary changes to the app. Another thing I don’t like is the community feed. There needs to be an option to turn that off because I have no interest in see all the spam posted there. I didn’t update the app for a long time for a specific reason. I didn’t want to deal with all the terrible changes made to the app. But about a week ago the app just completely stopped working so I was sadly forced to update. But now I think I’m just going to delete the app and go to coin gecko because the app is garbage now. So good job CoinMarketCap.,2022-05-30 15:42:29,BeastCH1,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
3,"Great app until recently. I am going to echo what some others have said. The app is pretty good just like their actual web site is great. That was until recently with an update or so. Now things do not load or update unless I force close the app and relaunch.  Then it may work for awhile.

This is quite frustrating as two of the features I like best, portfolio tracker & watchlist, are hampered by this. 

The portfolio tracker is, in my opinion, one of the best features of Coin Market Cap. If you are like most of us in crypto you have coins at several exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Phemex, etc..  The portfolio tracker lets you put in your transactions and fees so you can track your overall gains/losses by coin and as a total.",2021-09-03 19:52:28,Gmonwy,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
5,"This is a great app but can use some improvement. This app definitely gives me more options for cryptocurrency then Robinhood; the improvements I would like to see is the search bar be more accessible from the home menu and my watch list not buried with the the other taps on the Home Screen.

The executive team at CMC is undermining parts of what the essence of cryptocurrency and related projects are about at their core. - I posted criticism of the World Economic Forum, and it’s founder, two times on a chat thread… and I’ve now been permanently banned from using the chat feature. ***To put this in perspective, I posted the same exact critique well over 10 times on Twitter, and Twitter (very pro-censorship) didn’t take it down or warn me. It’s disgusting, nauseating, and beyond concerning that CMC is in bed with big-tech and other corrupt special interests. This is NOT what crypto stands for, and I am passionately organizing a campaign in the various crypto communities that I’m active in, and we will make it known that CMC has been corrupted.

5,"Fantastic resource for crypto!. CoinMarketCap has been my go-to crypto tracker from day one! The UI is extremely organized and all the information is accurate and easy to comprehend. I like that there are in-depth descriptions of every Coin/Token so if you don’t know what a certain one represents, you can read all the info underneath the charts. What makes each unique, who started it, the websites and much more available for each one. I’d pay for this app but it’s free!

3,"portfolio is terrible, bad as connecting to wifi. This app always stalls and claims not to be connected to the internet, 10x more finicky than any other app I have. I also wasted time entering some of my portfolio from binance, it lumps every coin together and only shows me how up % or down I am as a whole, vs each individual crypto holding, which is useless to me. I want to see the stats for each coin I hold. Binance can already tell me if my whole bag is up or down. So it’s kinda useless. Otherwise I guess it’s good for reading news articles but I originally downloaded it for price alerts and they always come hours after the fact.",2021-11-07 09:50:15,turtledove223344,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us

Constantly dealing with bugs and issues. Been using for months and keep having problems. Assets just disappearing off the list-with months and hours of entries gone, entries not being added or subtracted, blank page-not showing any assets. Save yourself the time and frustration.

1,"Circulating Supply of Shib is wrong. Early last week, the circulating supply of Shib suddenly gained an extra 200,000 Trillion. CMC acknowledged the issue and said it was an engineering bug. On Friday, they began telling us that the circulating supply was fixed, yet it has not actually been fixed. The extra 200,000 T are still there. CMC is the “source of truth” for many exchanges and investors. This effects the valuation of Shib in a bad way as circulating supply is part of the algorithm. It has been almost a week of an important part of valuation being wrong for only 1 crypto asset and rumors are starting to fly that this is intentional market manipulation on CoinMarketCap’s side.

Absolutely nothing, not a single notification.

The FED case isn’t related to Saitama Inu, it’s only related to someone who is helping push their project.

Hiding projects in the 200’s that have multi billion market caps. Why aren’t they listed where they belong? We can’t put doge coin and shiba in the top ten and dare say anything else doesn’t deserve its place. Hex and safemoon and multiple other projects are hidden in the ranks. Why? If your company is called market cap than list things by market cap. Not biased opinion. This hurts crypto. A huge platform such as this should be honest regardless of opinion.

Second, the percentages they say the token has increased/decreased is never accurate. They’ll say a coin is up 100% in the last 24 hours but it’s exactly the same price. Third, this app has deleted my watchlist three times now. I’ve deleted and reinstalled this app three times and each time it deletes my watchlist. Fourth, once I select a token to add to my watchlist, this app thinks I am deleting it, so it’s a struggle just to get this app to accept that I’ve selected a token for my watchlist.

Other apps don’t allow me to view some things(I think it’s region based). So yeah ! I’d recommend it to anyone 👍🏾",2021-06-04 19:56:21,Kowowole,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us

Think twice about using this app they will screw you out of your money when they see your investment at ath they will all of a sudden change data to stop it in its tracks good example shiba inu was on a huge streak and in the middle of the night while everyone was sleeping changed the data without any reason why to the public if that isn’t market manipulation idk what is think twice before using this app and I messeged them to see why this happened as did thousands of others radio silence do u really want ur cash with people that manipulate and ignore u I know I don’t,2021-11-05 16:44:37,briannichols,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
1,"Do not use! WARNING. CMC= coin market cap. CMC knowingly let shiba circulating to be listed with incorrect information even after being told by the developer and the shiba army that no new coins can ever be created. It took CMC 5-6 months to fix that issue. Yet if they get hacked and it shows millions of %’s they fix that instantly. Shiba hasn’t recovered from CMC’s first mistake. Now they are listing incorrect false addresses for shiba and the shiba developer again has been in contact with them, yet they don’t do anything. CMC reputation is going down the drain.

You must ALWAYS be able to trust an investment source. Their mistake will cost YOU, not them, and there will be no way to recoup. In late Oct early Nov 2021, a poorly done and bad report by CBM generated FUD that contributed to a 50% dip. Much money was lost by small Shib holders susceptible to FUD. They dumped in a large way. Whales bought the dip. I’m not a whale, but knew better than to believe what could not be substantiated, did not dump, and bought the dip.

1,Incorrect Calculation Methods. CMC does not provide a fair and even way of calculating the TMC which means that the prices and ratios are incorrect as well.  Rather than using the same method to calculate the TMC for each coin it uses different methods for different coins in an effort to affect the market.  I would never use CMC again as the false information it’s providing will lead investors in the wrong direction.  There are several other apps out there that provide actual facts rather than false and misleading information.  If you choose to use CMC just keep in mind the information displayed is incorrect per the crypto market regulations as will most likely lead you to making a bad decision.,2018-11-30 16:41:19,Avenger19823,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us

Also, Saitama has enough market cap to be listed on their top 100 and CMC refuses to list Saitama on there giving some weak excuse that they are “working on it”. Well, when it comes to placing an ad promoting false FUD, they were certainly on top of that.

1,Glitches Glitches and more Glitches. When first installing this app I was very impressed. They had every crypto under the sun and it was so easy to use. The convenience of creating a watch list of all your favorite crypto and being able to watch and track all of them in one spot just blew me away. Two weeks later 90% of all my cryptos disappeared from my watch list. I can’t even make a new list because that disappears as well. I can’t set alerts anymore and I can’t track any of my crypto so it went from a 5 star app to a 1 star unusable app.,2021-06-15 16:10:24,Dtronz,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us

Half the time I don’t get an alert and the other half I get the alert like 10 minutes after it has already happened. I even have been on my phone in another app knowing that I should be getting an alert and I don’t. What good is an alert going to be if it happens well after?! If you are planning on using this to hopefully save you some money by getting alerts then don’t bother.

5,Bitcoin stolen. Hello. After you scammed me by stolen  all the bitcoin in my wallet and you decided not to show all the history which it will give you better way for me not to have any proof which is a lie. I need my bitcoin that you stole in my wallet back because I just don’t understand how you’re scamming people and you’re here telling people that you’re trustworthy and honest. Your company is a big scammer because is the second times this will happen to me whenever I log out of the app. When I login back all my bitcoins would have gone without remain 1 bitcoin even those I saved in some others wallet you also stole it and am telling you right now that I will tell the whole worlds about your scamming ways and that your company is a scammer. I will sue your company if my bitcoin is not return and all the history because I have everything in my email and I will make sure I do everything to shut down your stupid scammer company. Blockchain is a scammer app and scammer company.,2021-10-24 02:35:40,BuhariMua,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"Very poor support service. Blockchain asked for 3 Document as compulsory, which I don’t have all three, Passport, ID card and Driving license, I am too old to drive and I don’t have passport, I only have an ID card. I think Blockchain just scammed me, and are playing a Charlie Charlie game to fool me. Blockchain is currently declining the ID card which they accepted at first and got me verified, so why ?Blockchain’s service is very poor when it comes to gold verification. They will seize your crypto in the name of holding your funds safe because of their so called custodial wallet (trading wallet). Do not use their custodial wallet(trading wallet), but you can use their (private key wallet). ...after I had my gold level verification successful, I bought crypto and as a new user i forget my password and had to login with 12 word phrase, they deactivated my gold level verification and asked I should reverify, I had to reverify. It is 3 weeks now and I have not got verified for gold level again, I thought it was approximately 5 days for verification ...blockchain’s verification team is really slow and poor in response, I lost my profit and some percentage of my initial crypto, because they have restricted me from withdrawing, swapping or selling to my account. I won’t advice anyone to use the gold verified blockchain.",2022-02-25 05:36:07,97druid,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
5,"Clearing the air. I’m writing this review to clear the air because there are a lot of negative reviews. I was in a similar situation with a lot of these reviewers where my balance was showing $0.00 on the app, when I did have a few coins. However, I found out that my account was under review due to the large amount I deposited. After a week of providing documents that they requested and needed, my account was lifted and I was able to have my funds transfer out successfully to my other wallet. If you’re having issues, be sure to open a ticket and use their website and not the app (only open 1 ticket and be patient, I’m sure they’re short staffed and overwhelmed with tickets they have to follow up on) and provide documents as needed and the blockchain team will assist you. Even if it takes a week or two to gain access to your funds (please know that I almost thought this app was a scam but they are not a scam) my funds transferred successfully.",2021-07-26 15:36:11,TSLA PAPI,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
3,"This app needs work. For 5 days I’ve tried to transfer from my trading wallet to btc wallet, error every time. Contacted customer service and a guy named Shawn said oh I’m so sorry for your troubles bla bla bla.  I replied and nothing. Open and tickle and yet another ticket no response. Customer service is useless at best. How disappointing this is. 
The other problem is that this company still uses the absolute slowest network. If your btc address starts with a 1 not only are you going to get slow transactions but slow everyone else down too. Why hasn’t this been upgraded yet. The new technology has been around for years now. With this alone I’m looking for a new place to go. But the kicker is the horrible customer service. I still haven’t got a solution or a reply offering to help.  
There is also times that if you want to sell say $50 or whatever the fees are insane. I went to trade 50 and the fee was $9 are you kidding me? 
You guys need to fix the issue with sending from the trading wallet to your btc wallet immediately. It’s not working at all.

1,"Horrible. Don’t bother, I just wanted $60 on these fake ppl. I scoured the website looking limits and good times and nothing listed, zero warnings etc. You buy BTC and once you buy they tell you sorry haha we will hold your funds for 3 days!!!!! What’s worse it says pending deposit and zero instructions on what’s next! Save your nerves and money I think these guys are fake! To make matters worse zero help, no one to call, NO ONE!!!! Completely zero customer service! And it wount even allow you to send the money you have in the account. $50 but I can only send .80 cents. I decided to file a report against this app and website with Apple and the authorities! This is a joke

Update: it just got worse and worse.  Support answered 2 hours after email (great) unfortunately all they do is copy and paste some generic information and refuse to fix my issue and are giving me the run around.  No one knows why I can’t take out my money or send a payment and last night they broke off all contact and now are totally refusing to answer!    I have decided to report to the authorities where I am and where they are located!

What’s going on with blockchain, I did a swap from Bitcoin to usdt on oct 25th and the money was gone so my thought was that it’s going to trade so I can have my money on usdt and since then the trade has been showing pending, fast forward today which is 1st of November, when I opened my wallet I saw a trade on my wallet showing that my swap trade has been sent has btc to another wallet, why is this please, I’m really freaking out right now, I never did send my money to another Wallet address, I only did swap my Bitcoin to usdt, please I need to talk with your support center as soon as possible because I need my money back and besides the swap is still showing pending till now",2021-11-01 09:09:06,Kelecharles,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"Multiple issues. Ever since i upgraded my blockchain sometime in July I Hilton this new trading account option, whenever I use this trading account I don’t get transaction history which I kind of learnt to manage but then on Wednesday I made a mistake to receive about $7000 Bitcoin in my trading account of which I got a message from blockchain saying I passed my annual silver level swap limit of $1999 and at first I didn’t know I got a mail so I went ahead and sent $500 to my private key wallet, And both $6800 and $80 to a different Bitcoin address which never arrived at their destination so I wrote your support and I was told to upgrade to gold level and my pending withdrawals will be approved which I did yesterday and still I haven’t seen neither of the btc sent. I’ve then wrote your support again and I either get a similar programmed response or am ignored 
I need this money for my mum’s medical bills!!!
Do you want my mum’s death to be your hands???

3,Transaction Flagged. I just wanna say I’ve had a lot of downside with this app then upsides. Not only at first when I downloaded I had suspicious activity so I couldn’t make a purchase then had to re confirm my identity but now my transaction was “Flagged” For a reason I can’t be told. I tried reaching out to support but it’s been almost a week and no response. I was told a response but yet still haven’t received anything. In the past I haven’t had any trouble sending or receiving any form of crypto currency’s so at first I thought it was just taking longer than usual. Yet it’s been a week and so yet again i’ve asked multiple people from their support team and i still have yet to hear a response or get the reason why i was “Flagged”. Any time I ask they say it’s from a team above them and that I have to wait for the support ticket. I’m just tired of waiting for my cryto to ever arrive. At this point i’m sure they stole it or something else.,2022-08-08 13:17:58,h3roic46,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"One…. And Done?. I bought Bitcoin on here one time, everything was fine. After a few months I decided to buy more, last night. You’d think I’d be able to get right on the app and just buy some. I have my card linked to my account. I entered how much I wanted to buy, I got an error message. I tried it again thinking it was a glitch, still nothing. I got on my computer and tried that, same thing. I contacted support and tried to get some help. Someone by the name of Ming was zero help, in fact they said this all happened because of something I did. I was informed, after ten failed attempts their system blocks your card from use. I only tried a total of four.

Ming tried to send me links to wire money, the two links I got didn’t even help with my issue. I spent over an hour on this chat to get answers and none was given. Sadly I left chat more upset then when I actually got on, after chat I sent an email to Blockchain to get more answers.

They replied in a timely manner. The information looked good, it felt like more help then what I got from Ming on their chat help. After doing what the email said, it still won’t take my card. I’m stuck in limbo right now, and unless Blockchain can actually help me figure out what happened I won’t be using them anymore.

I didn’t appreciate Ming implying I did something wrong, there was nothing professional about the help I got from this person. When I get a reply from Blockchain and hopefully get this figured out, I may update this review.",2021-10-22 06:01:57,Than[Q],Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"Stole my money and customer service won’t do anything about it. I downloaded this app in march of 2021 and put in approx. $70 into BTC. After a while I went to withdraw my funds and the real problem of this scam app began. For a while, my bank was supported and I theoretically could’ve withdrawn, but the loading process always took too long and never went through. Then the app updated itself to require a new level of verification to buy/sell, which upon sending in my info I was told something was incorrect and it wasn’t verified for nearly 6 MONTHS. I had emailed CS about it roughly 1 month into no word back and I didn’t get a response until AFTER the problem was solved 5 months later. Even after my ID has been verified and such I still cannot withdraw my funds because my (once supported) bank is no longer supported! What’s even more crazy is that CS takes so long to respond that it’s almost just not worth reaching out anymore. Don’t get this app, they’re literally just trying to steal your money.",2022-08-24 13:43:11,Panzer_Punisher,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"Customer support. Blockchain needs to work on their customer service big time!  If they respond to you it is just a cut and paste answer from what you can read on their “frequently asked questions” page, it is like they only read part of your issue and find the best answer to match it from their list of “frequently asked questions”.  If you have a more technical issue that is not covered in their “frequently asked questions “ then they don’t answer or look into your question further they just send you the same “frequently asked questions”.
The problem is their “frequently asked questions” don’t cover every issue and so then their customer support doesn’t seem to know what to do so they just quit answering your requests.
There is no phone number to speak to a real person which is even more frustrating and shows they really don’t care.
I would recommend people move to Coinbase, their support is unbelievable and if you call them they will spend whatever time you need til your questions are answered.",2019-02-23 15:45:27,ScrawnyShawnee,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
2,"RELIABILITY ISSUES. There were a few times i had some login issues from using this application. First time, It said login fail and then it keeping spinning for a long time, then I finally got in and my balance was 0, i was totally freaked out, then i try to click on dashboard back and forth, and finally my account balance was back to normal. And today, it just happened again. I tried to login and it failed, i kept trying for 10 minutes and it said the said thing. So I decided to login thru the website and I finally got in and my account balance was 0 but the icon is showing that it trying to download the information, but it was keeping doing that for long times so i decided to click on the menu i found a refresh button, so click it, and finally my actual account balance appeared as normal.

2,"Frustrating. I decided to invest a little in this wallet.  I’d had the app for a few years but have been using Coinbase, Celsius and BlockFi so far.  Great interest rates at BlockFi and Celsius by the way.  Check out rates on USDC in BlockFi-presently 8%!  Anyway, I saw an offer for interest in Blockchain.  I put in some money.  Never got a penny of interest.  Tried to swap to another coin.  Kept “expiring” before the swap.  Also, it was charging me $5 to switch from one stable coin to another.  Tried sending to a different wallet.  It wouldn’t let me.  Finally decided to cash out.  I discovered they put a 14 day hold on your money before you can cash out.  I had 2 transactions so I got my first one.  Waiting more days to get the rest.  Impossible to find acceptable information online.  Definitely appreciate Coinbase much more now.  That’s my main app I purchase through.  The Blockchain wallet is like a dinosaur.  Either needs reworking or to be discontinued.",2021-09-09 18:46:10,Psalmy,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"100% you will be  Scammed. I was completely scammed out of over $13,000. There was no support to even reach to. I have 4 passwords and took every single security measure none of my passwords were shared with anyone and somehow some random party was able to log into my account and send out a transaction to an undisclosed wallet. How is the even possible. The security has to either be very low or inside jobs are going on never the less non of your information is safe. You have to think If they can go in and submit a transaction with my login information then the have access to pull from my bank accounts on file as well all while it would look like I did the transaction. Absolutely no security to any of your personal information. Do not trust this site or app there are several loopholes in the security that can surely lead to you becoming a victim of a cyber scam.

2,"Worst app ever no warnings. Worst staff ever they don’t warn you that you have to have a three day hold when you first purchase any type of bitcoin or online currency. You get to sit there and watch the next three days as your money fluctuates without you being able to control single time. And then you keep on eating fees because they don’t have your bank on their list of certified banks. So then you have to eat even more fees just transfer it out to a personal wallet to transfer it to cash app the most easiest method of buying and selling best coin I have ever come across. This is the most complicated app is not user-friendly is not for beginners it is not for anyone that is trying to break into the cryptocurrency world. I rate this thieving app  two our give an will never be back. 
There easier and more secure apps out there than this one I do not recommend. Unless you’re looking to lose your money",2022-01-24 03:57:38,Xoxo1234!,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
2,"Beware of fees. If you top up $500 and buy USDC, which is valued at $1, you will only get $485.  Yes, you will see at before you hit confirmation that there is no fee, but, the USDC will become something like $1.03 on the buy screen, which is easy to miss, and it is very possible that you will just hit confirm and end up losing $15 in a second.
Another thing is that the transactions are never instant.  So after you buy coins, they are usually not there even after a minute.  Watch out because if your hand moves too fast, you will end up creating multiple repetitious transactions like me.  I was trading on Dec 3, but on Dec 10, a transaction showed up saying ""failed"", which was just an failed attempt I made seven days ago due to transactions being not instant. 
Do yourselves a favor.  Use BlockFi, Celcius, Hodlnaut, and DimeFi.  Do not use blockchain as your main place of trading.",2021-12-18 05:19:34,iris_x,Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"Doesn’t allow debit or credit card purchases, slow/no support. I wanted to like this app. It’s clean, it’s well-organized, but it doesn’t *do* what it’s supposed to do. After going through the entire verification process, it does not allow debit card purchases to go through. I called my bank, who authorized the transaction, but only ever saw a $0 authentication come through after multiple attempts. The blockchain error was generic, just saying to try again. I eventually transferred Bitcoin to my wallet here to send to a third party, but again, it refused the transfer, citing an “invalid wallet.” After digging and digging, it looks like Blockchain doesn’t support Bech32 addresses, but it would’ve been nice for the app to provide this error message specifically.

I ended up losing half my portfolio because their glitches and would not reimburse me after I submitted pictures as evidence, the servise representative even tried to play it off as there was nothing out of the ordinary until I crop zoomed the section showing the glitch and they said they would let management know but wouldn’t reimburse me my money then ended the conversation. I switched the remaining of my portfolio to another exchange right then and there.

I have spoken with their support team an insane amount of times which takes hours (at most 6 and 7 hours) to get to talk to someone just for them to say “oh the refund has been processed, but let me escalate this. Is there anything else I can help you with?” I would never use this brokerage firm in a million years after this. They just take your money and say they are “working on it”.

It’s been a very slow process for me and I still don’t know why.

4,"Ease of Use. If you are the person applying for this form of crypto currency you are going to have an easy time. I suggest that you do have your Id’s all together. My financial world took a turn and years ago (39 years ago) I had the rank of Lieutenant in the Army and another service branch. On record I was discharged Honorable and had an enlisted rank on my entry. 
My name was changed in 1988. I did that on my own and performed lawful entry in Court in California and filed in VIRGINIA later. 
There were some limits on my parents living in VIRGINIA and it made it difficult to get REAL-ID conditions.
Last month I sold a property in California and deposited the money in my brokerage.
Then I recognized something, my Uncle had a step son that was an Episcopalian Bishop. That was both good and bad. Etc. …

I feel like if it’s not supported it shouldn’t be listed as an option.  Needless to say I’ve emailed customer support to delete my account....I also had an issue with having to share so much of my personal information to verify my account before I can do any transactions.  I understand it’s for security purposes but it just doesn’t sit right with me.

I thought it was a bug forgetting the last coin in the list so I added more and it still randomly forgot them. But they were still in my favorites list when searching. I had to clear my search terms and clear the favorite ""star"" mark and search again to mark it again then a coin like LTC would appear.

Tried again and again.

One nice feature is the drag slide to see exact price on a date, something you'd expect as a bare minimum feature but is missing on my favorite app right now.",2021-10-11 03:55:24,HawaiiMaui,The Crypto App - Coin Tracker,Apple App Store,us

None of them are nearly as easy to navigate as this one and I literally just opened it up five minutes ago and it took me 30 seconds to realize that this was gonna be my new number one day trading app!!!

Update (10 seconds later)..lol
And another thing, most exchanges have far more features and accessibility on their actual website, but this application is literally designed to mimic the website but even easier! This is a first for me finding an app this good in the App Store and general much less a crypto currency trading application which are very hard to come by as it is on iOS",2018-03-15 07:59:54,01badss,OKX,Apple App Store,us

And 1.5 months they just stopped responding to support messages just ignoring. Finally they canceled the withdrawal transaction and fund came back. I suspect this exchange has liquidity problems or has Bernd’s hacked or something therefore they just froze customers funds - how convenient.

1,"Scam site. This app is part of a sophisticated scam. If someone you ‘meet’ online suggests you download it to invest in crypto, then report it to national fraud offices.  They are country specific. 

The app is pretty simple to use, but it’s a fake trading platform.  Any bitcoin you send them (or any crypto you think you have with them) has already gone. You’ve lost it. You can’t get it back. At some point the crypto you think you own will suddenly drop to low values and you’ll have been scammed.

5,"The beat sleekist most wicked app out there!!!!!!. This app in terms of app aesthetics is impeccable. That is standard for Exodus developers who produced the mac app as well. In terms of functionality, ease, utility, and asset management, this app is likewise impeccable. This app is probably the best app ever made in the appstore in terms of developers making a pleasing and functional app. A five star review isnt doing it justice. I was a bit sour because the developers took  soooooo long to finally create the mobile version of their desktop software. They’re response was they wanted to ensure that the mobile version would be just as sleek as their desktop version and they did not disappoint. When it finally came out, they did NOT disappoint! It is thee best most secure mobile wallet out there for mobile wallets second after the manual ledger flash drive version which is only really useful for people holding over 10k in assets which may be a good reason to invest in a ledger if you have that kind of investment. But Exodus comes second right after that. The best part of Exodus improvements is its exchange-like monetary management abilities like exchanging various currencies within its platform, something it did not have in its early days. Thus it enjoys having exchange-functions to its users WITHOUT actually being an exchange where the loss of data and hacking is much more likely to occur in the cryptosphere.
All the best!!!",2021-02-11 09:57:19,akhBori,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Awesome wallet. Highly recommended. Obviously being a software wallet, it’s not the most secure wallet out there for large holdings. Software wallets are notoriously unsafe due to risks created by malware and viruses and make your precious crypto highly vulnerable if the proper steps aren’t taken to protect your device. However, I get great utility using this wallet for short term transfers/transactions for services like Changelly and shapeshift or when I’m planning on trading a bit on a volatile day. The best thing this wallet has going for it is the convenience of it whether it’s on your computer or on mobile. My primary wallet for storage is a ledger and admittedly it’s very annoying to have to bring it with you if you’re planning on potentially using it as well as having to plug it into your computer whenever you want to send assets. The wallet also has an exchange feature with reasonable fees in comparison to something like coinbase but with a larger selection of assets, which is extremely useful for a quick exchange without having to move it anywhere. Where this wallet lack in security, it makes up for in convenience 10 fold. All in all, I’d highly recommend this wallet for traders, but for hodlers I’d suggest going with something more secure and just using it as a transfer mechanism",2019-11-11 07:18:39,mduchow,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Nice wallet and helpful staff. So after literally months of digging into every crypto wallet available, I’ve chosen Exodus as my go to. I’ll keep it short while highlighting key components that won me over.
 1. It’s both a wallet and portfolio tracker! No other platform has the ability to let hold your own private keys while simultaneously giving you real-time data, charts and feedback about your holdings. 
2. Built in exchange! Piggybacking off my previous comment, the charting/data feature goes perfectly with the exchange. I like this because it allows me to trade and make proper adjustments to my portfolio without withdrawing my money. This feature is important because it allows you to maintain proper security of your private keys. 
3. Helpful staff! When I had a question related to their desktop platform I sent an email to staff. To my amazement I had a reply within 20 minutes of my initial message. 
If anyone reading this is like me and very indecisive... go with this wallet. It’s secure, visually appealing, and has the benefits of a wallet, exchange, and tracker built in one.",2019-06-10 05:00:49,ndkxicirnrnc,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
1,"Buggy, lack of support. I’ve been using exodus for about one year and I’ve noticed that my wallet  balance is often incorrectly high  when I first open the app, and then it will adjust down to the correct account balance after a few seconds. That’s annoying enough but yesterday when I checked my balance it went from the correct balance down to a very low and very incorrect balance. As I looked closer I saw that my ETH had just disappeared into thin air. I quit the app, re opened it, refreshed the wallet, and it was still the same. I contacted support and got one email  asking me to confirm that my transaction history seemed legit. I did not have time to crunch all the numbers but it seemed ok so I told them yes. I sent another email asking to confirm that they received my info and that they were working on the problem. I have gotten no further response from them despite repeated requests for an update on my case. They are not helping me. My ETH is gone. I’m 99% certain that my personal account was not hacked or compromised by myself because if it were they would have taken all of it instead of only taking 95% of my ETH. It appears that a couple of BTC-ETH exchanges that I made are not showing up in my wallet as ETH that I received. I’m not happy. I will be removing all of the rest of my coins from Exodus and looking for a better place to keep them.",2021-09-14 19:33:45,plinkerplop,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
3,"Intuitive UI/UX; Exorbitant minimums to transact. This team has done great things to provide people with a privacy-oriented window to the crypto world and defi. I love the fact that I can choose to buy with a bank card (of course forgoing anonymity) or choose to send in from another exchange. Access to ERC-20 tokens was awesome though i imagine it could be daunting for a newcomer to see a list of projects to choose from (best practice is to do your own research!!!). There are brief descriptions of projects in the “About” sections. Of course they have access to most if not all major large cap coins.

Some things to keep in mind for newcomers: if you don’t know what gas fees are, you could very well pay more for a swap than you would want to if fees, potentially killing any profits you make. I used the platform to get access to certain coins and either sent them to cold storage or had them sitting for when the gains come. Another thing is that there are minimums required to exchange coins and ive seen this “minimum” steadily increase with the market. Seemingly the minimum is always juuuuust above what I have - I think it’s time to put my tinfoil hat on and remember what the word “Exodus” means",2021-02-22 17:28:25,BOTO PRO,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Not your keys, NOT YOUR COINS.... If you don’t hold your own private keys to your crypto currency, you don’t OWN anything and you’re at risk. Get Exodus, the interface is straight forward and easily understood. It also happens to be beautiful!

 Hung up trying move crypto using private addresses help is a click away. Don’t understand the fee schedules, need help setting custom fees for smart contracts... Exodus has easy four min reads along with short videos to get you up and running. 

I run Exodus in conjunction with a Trezor hardware wallet and I’m loving the sense of financial freedom. No more middlemen between me and control of my digital assets. No more asking permission. I can get paid in Bitcoin for my services and have it available on Exodus for exchange or put it in cold storage on my Trezor within the hour. Take control, stop asking for permission to transact and stop paying ludicrous fees on Coinbase. Learn to use crypto exchanges and take back your digital freedom. The further is here get engaged or get left behind!",2021-05-31 04:31:08,Eddie 77,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Not scam after all. I have used this app for several months. Until this point I would have been an advocate for it. I deposited btc into my wallet and attempted an exchange for XMR immediately after the transaction was finished. I got an error message for the exchange and my btc had been sent to an address that I had not entered. I contacted support and was told I could contact my local police. This is an error on Exodus’s part. Be prepared to lose your money and then have support tell you your wallet was compromised. I was not logged out, there was a technical issue on their part and to skirt responsibility for their own mistakes they’re casting the blame on others. 

 Shortly after making this review my money was reimbursed. If the apps developers reimbursed me out of pocket, im truly impressed. The fact is I followed the btc to a known scammer. I was also given my XMR. Truly outstanding service if I was reimbursed out of pocket.",2021-08-15 02:02:14,csimhmons,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"No Competion. Hands-down by far the most absolutely best of all crypto wallets by a long stretch. Prompt and reactionary support staff. Anonymous exchange regardless of Geo location. Seamless integration with Trezor cold storage. Master 12 word seed phrase and backup is as easy as it gets. Security of desktop and mobile apps actually feel secure. Higher fees than market average but to bypass uploading an ID and giving up bank information and all of the unnecessary central bank implications and requirements leaves Exodus ahead of the rest sticking to the true foundation and philosophy of the block chain, as intended, is priceless. Custodial options if you choose to do so . .  I have one issue and that is the 12 word seed phrase is exposed on the display when being typed with no option to hide it during a restore. Please add feature. Perhaps a clipboard wiper/blocker and keylogger blocker is possible. I appreciate every single one of you.",2020-11-05 21:41:24,Liberty Dawg,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"3+ Year User on Computer; Mobile is a Nice Touch. I have gone back and forth on what constitutes the easiest / safest option to store my crypto’s. I’ve used several wallets (both mobile and on a PC), Exodus and settled upon the Ledger Nano S and Exodus for one Token. Because I’m a “Hodler” and not a day to day trader I ended up removing everything from my Ledger and going back to Exodus a couple weeks ago. I did this because I got sick of the constant updates for the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Live and the need for the 12 phrase set with each update (via Ledger Live 🤦🏻‍♂️). Just a bit too cumbersome for a guy that checks on things one or twice a year. I discovered the Mobile Exodus at this time, quite nice to see things more frequently. Haven’t tried to trade, transfer or exchange anything via the Mobile app yet, but for what I need, this works great. I do wish Exodus would add Theta and T-Fuel to their crypto/token offerings.",2021-01-28 08:50:43,Woodwardfam,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Customer Service is Great. I have just recently moved my crypto holdings to exodus because the UI really had me sold. A few coins never arrived to the wallet and yet the blockchain scanners showed the transaction was done correctly and completed. I contacted support and the team were extremely helpful in understanding the situation (they also have a send a report feature which allows them to deal with your case with more information which is great). The real people are focused on your case and are able to deal much better with issue than automated team which is a great plus. My issue was fixed rapidly and the customer support agent I worked with was well spoken, prompt, and very helpful with solving my issue successfully. The UI is great and so are the staking opportunities, but the customer support is what really got me sold on this hot wallet.",2021-07-26 03:56:55,Brieodbfiakehr,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
4,"Good apps but needs to fix update notifications.. Really like the iOS and windows apps, but the windows app has a permanent notification that’s says an update is available, and it doesn’t give an option to update. The link just takes you to a blog post they posted on their website with instructions that don’t coincide with the current state of the app. They should just have a button that directs you directly to the update (or remove the notification if their isn’t actually an update). I just downloaded the iOS app and the first thing that came up was a notification to update the app. If I just downloaded it from the App Store then why would it need updated? The iOS store doesn’t have an available update, so it makes me think something is wrong with the app, or management just doesn’t care about keep things up to date and accurately informative. Staking is easy.",2021-11-02 17:09:03,thrivingproject,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Just started using it.. After checking out reviews online and seeing this app gets significant and impressive reviews, I download it and began using. First off, the interface is gorgeous. I love how beautiful they have designed it. Secondly, so far with the minimal actions I’m taking, using the app is a joy. It’s super easy and intuitive. I might add a future review later as I begin doing more than just loading crypto onto the platform. But for what I’ve experienced up to now, I am loving this new wallet.

I only wish my state was not one of the states that prohibits active exchanges through this app. If I can use that process this would be a perfect app. I would give the app four stars because of this, but it is not the developers’ fault that my state does not allow such functionality, that’s five stars.",2021-12-02 05:23:06,Perkygrubb,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
3,"Very good, some minor issues. Huge offering of different cryptos, ability to buy BTC, and the ability to exchange between cryptos directly within the app is all great. The main complaint I have is that the graphs aren’t always accurate. Sometimes my balance is shown dipping to 0, sometimes I supposedly gained 30% of my portfolio value in an hour, with no transactions or price changes that would have caused such a change. Also when viewing my balance for a certain coin, the initial number is correct but when I drag my finger along the graph, the value changes in $, but displays as if the number of coins I have is what is changing. Another issue is there doesn’t seem to be a way to view my available balance after purchasing BTC. I would expect to be able to send all of what I’ve purchased, or see what the wait is caused by. Overall it’s a great wallet, though these issues do cause headaches at times.",2021-04-17 01:49:05,soy54uce,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"App, company is trash (updated). I’ve used Exodus awhile and went to make an exchange that said would only cost me a difference of $5. Nowhere did it say there was a .025 ETH fee before I made this transaction, otherwise I would’ve never done it. This app stole (now) $80 from me on a very insignificant transaction and all I get is automated e-mails when I demand an explanation as to why I wasn’t prompted about this ETH fee beforehand. So hire more support and be a lot more clear about your fees cuz I am incredibly angry about your garbage app

To developer who responded: if it was my error why did support refund the ETH to me? Elizabeth T from support helped me out flawlessly, and she is the reason I am changing my rating to five stars and am now satisfied with the product. Took a month to get to me but the result was what I wanted. Thank you.",2021-05-20 13:45:45,Sytarg,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
1,"Lots of fees. Exodus does offer a neat looking app with a large quantity of crypto that can be traded however, unlike other exchanges Exodus charges a rather large import fee... luckily for me it was only a small transfer as a test but nevertheless burned $10 (in this case 20% of the transfer lol) all that without even making a single trade. It’s also worth noting that each trade itself could be about ~$10 in fees even when exchanging crypto-crypto. I would advise caution and doing your homework prior to using this app because the high import fees, high exchange fees, and trade minimums which all vary depending on type of crypto and could easily lead one to burn a significant portion of an account just trying to exchange one crypto for another. I promptly transferred my remainder out to another wallet which strangely had the only reasonable fee in line with industry standard applied to that transaction (~2¢). In my opinion this is a shady operation while I won’t say there isn’t some fine print describing all these fees it certainly isn’t what I would call “transparent”.",2021-02-15 11:55:37,mistabig,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
2,"Clean, pretty, expensive. Looks are cool.  They do however make the assumption that you want a dark background.  There should at least allow an option for light backgrounds too. (You can choose textures, colors, and other features, but all the options are dark. 
Unlike most other sites, there is a few (paid in Ethereum) for most exchanges between Cryptocurrencies.  This makes it more expensive if you do a lot of trading (my original reason for opening this account.)  I’ll leave the few crypto I have here, but this has just become my “hold” account, not my trading account. 
Exodus’s options—the Apps—may one day provide more useful features.   I’d like one that allows you to immediately see what you put in, what you have earned, and where it now stands.  (They have tools for seeing the % of your assets in any coin, but not your profit and loss).  
Try other tools first, and use this just as a final vault for holding crypto you won’t trade for years.",2021-02-13 16:38:03,David Eyerly,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"The wait is finally over!!. I’ve been a fan since day one of Exodus wallet. I had an issue on the desktop version in April of 2017 on a holiday weekend. I was shocked to have my call answered not by a voicemail, not by an employee but by the owners themselves. They handled my issue extremely quickly and professionally. After my first call that day I had to call back 2-3 times to get the issue handled that day. The phone never rang more than once and they knew immediately that it was me. I guess what I’m saying is they have the best customer support of any company I’ve ever dealt with, they take great care of making sure this is not only the best performing but also the most beautiful and easy to use Crypto Currency Wallet that I’ve used.

1,"if I could give this app less than a star I would!!!!. so let me just start by saying that I put in over $200 of Usdt-erc20 and now I cannot convert it to anything else like BTC or ETH without adding some additional ETH to the network but I’m not allow to convert a little bit of what is already there to have this covered...anyway nothing like trying to convert to crypto that are temporarily and are prefectly fine in the network but just do not work on their dumb app and when I try to send all of my money out of the wallet they say this is mandatory to have in order to make this type of transaction which I have never heard or seen before and would’ve been nice to have been aware of beforehand...oh, and don’t bother with their support staff because getting an email one time to address whtever issues may arise, every 72hrs is not very helpful at all...IMO opinion this app is garbage and needs to go back it development and testing until it actually starts to work without so many issues, seriously for real !!!!!",2021-03-10 15:05:40,allidro,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Love The App!. I really enjoy using this app. It’s very easy to navigate, especially for a person like myself, who is new in the crypto space. Their fees aren’t horrible, and, if you just plan on using it to just to secure some of your crypto...! It’s great for that. 
 Also, I had an issue. I had purchased ONT. The transaction went fine, BUT...! I later found out you have to have ONG in order to do anything with your ONT! There’s no exchanging or cashing out, without it. 
 So, I promptly contacted Exodus support. It took a few days for them to get back to me, but, they issued me the necessary amount of ONG to make transactions. That was fine, but, I still had to go off the Exodus wallet and find a place to get a ONG address, seeing how Exodus doesn’t support ONG (apparently working on a patch) 
Long story, longer...I finally got an address so I was able to import ONG into my Exodus wallet, and make the exchange that I was waiting to make. Thankfully!!! I didn’t lose any money while waiting. 
Otherwise, the app has worked pretty well, and, the Exodus team at least responded to, as well as provided me with the necessary crypto to make my transaction.

The one major flaw that this app has is that for some reason, I only get push notifications from the app when I’m actually on the app. If I’m not using my phone and my phone’s screen is asleep or if I’m using another app on my phone, Exodus will not notify me of anything. Please fix this issue so that we can receive push notifications whether we’re on the app or not! I’m using the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the most recent version of Exodus. I sometimes send funds to Exodus and have no idea when they arrive because I’m not being notified. I checked my notification settings in Exodus and on my phone’s settings and everything checks out. So it must be an issue with the app because I won’t get a notification that the funds have arrived until I actually click on the Exodus app.",2022-04-20 13:46:12,dfw_toon,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Best crypto wallet ever. #1 I think you guys should really really add a feature that shows you at what price you got into another crypto. So if I exchange BTC for ETH and I do it when ETH is $1,000 then it should always show that I got into it when it was $1,000 that way if it goes up and I want to sell then I know okay I bought in or exchanged at $1k so I want to take out x amount only. It should also let me go directly from BTC and ALL other cryptos without asking me the amount I want to convert so if I want to buy a laptop or something and it cost $2,000 and I want to use Cardano to pay then I can just click on BTC and say I want to pay in ADA and boom it does all the conversations on its own and all I say to the app is that they want $2,000 USD",2021-09-14 21:38:32,DevilsTestament,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
4,"Almost perfect!. This is a very easy-to-use software wallet that supports quite a wide variety of tokens and coins, including BSV specifically which is one of the reasons I was led to it.

After conducting a few test transactions in and out, testing the restore functionality on a separate iOS device, as well as reading a number of reviews online about the wallet, I feel confident to begin using it regularly for day-to-day activities.

However, I have to refrain from giving 5 stars because of a cosmetic design flaw… no landscape support for iPad! Why, when people have been using iPads in landscape mode for years now (with the Apple keyboard cover or similar) do so many app-makers force vertical-only orientation on their iPad apps? Seems like such a simple thing to fix. Exodus is far from the only offender here. If they fix that, I’ll bump up this review to 5 stars.",2020-01-05 22:08:38,fyreous,Exodus,Apple App Store,us

I think I have more than a basic understanding of crypto and how it works, and how wallets work. as time went on, the desktop version kept getting more clunked up with aesthetics. I still have it on my computer but I really don't use it.  now I really need a mobile wallet. I download it this thing once a while back and I gave it a try. I wound up deleting it because it was too difficult to navigate. About a year might've passed and I downloaded it again. I tried...I really did. It is just too much. There are so many bells and whistle's now, that one just gets lost in a complex maze of psycho Circus. it would be nice to see Exodus return to the roots and make an easy to use easy to navigate mobile wallet. cheers to the people that can navigate this ""matrix"" but unfortunately I am not one of them.",2022-09-10 01:04:41,Eldaereanoth Araquinalo,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Missing very useful feature.. Hey, thanks for the consistent updates. I do have one request that I’m sure quite a few other people are interested in though. So, currently in the charts within exodus you can only hold 1 finger and move it along the chart to see the price based on where your 1 finger is touching the chart, but a 2 finger touch on the charts used for determining price changes within a specified range defined by the distance between the two fingers touching the chart would be very useful. This functionality is available in the default/native iOS stock app, and the Robinhood app, and quite a few others. 

Hopefully I explained the 2 finger price chart functionality in a way that is understandable. Either way, thanks. Have a good one!",2020-08-04 07:03:52,DoorDashReview,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
4,"Suggestions as well as a minor bug fix. Sometimes the chart displays inaccurate data. For example there will be an incline on the chart, but a decrease in price action will be displayed by the numbers instead of an increase. 

I’m sure many others as well as myself would love the option to choose a different chart pattern to read besides the line chart, such as the candlestick pattern chart. An advanced chart with volume displayed would be great.

Market cap, 24-hour volume data, etc. would be a nice feature to add too if possible.

Live real-time asset price updates as well as real-time currency balance updates as the price changes would be amazing. 

Bug fixes: my app kept telling me all day today that I needed to be connected to the internet, so I was unable to view my portfolio data while I was at work. This is my first time experiencing this and I believe it was due to my phone connecting to random public wifi’s while I was at work. Turning off my wifi and using my cellular data did not fix the issue, however I was able to use the app with no problem once I got home and connected to my wifi.

I’ve heard people say they’ve been charged a fee for exchanging cryptos. I have yet to be charged and have already done some exchanges. I personally like this platform more than Coinbase because of the wide variety of crypto’s available for trade/purchase and because it’s easier to setup. You guys rule.

The only thing that could make it better is supporting more coins, both on mobile and on desktop - their support for many coins is already the best, but there are still some that are not, namely theta and tfuel , among a few others.

I’ve waited up to 24 hours for a Bitcoin withdrawal on other apps and exchanges and with Exodus I’ve never waited longer than 5 minutes to receive a payment into the app or to receive a payment in another wallet sending from the app. Add on the ability to use Apple Pay to buy Bitcoin straight from the app and the the lowest fees out there- This app is always my #1 go to with anything Bitcoin.

1,They will steal your money!!!. I sent vechain to my Coinbase account without converting to Bitcoin first. I reached out to Coinbase and was told they didn’t accept the transfer as they don’t offer vechain. I then reached out to Exodus who told me that it could take thirty days and to contact them if I did not have the vechain back by then. It has now been 30+ days and the vechain has not been returned to my account. It’s 6000+ vechain currently valued over $1500! I am a mom.. in a pandemic.. who is on worker’s compensation.. I needed that money. They have ignored the last two times I contacted them. My messages have been respectful and professional. Yes I’m aware they have limitations once you send the money but it has been made very clear to me that because Coinbase rejected the transaction it should have been credited back to my exodus wallet..I really didn’t want to leave this review as this is the only issue I’ve ever had with Exodus,2021-03-20 18:17:45,C Mullins,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
4,Nice wallet with lots of staking interest rates. I used Exodus wallet for first time and found it to be really easy. They have many assets to earn interest on by staking and holding. Rewards are paid out on every staking deposit 25 days after EACH deposit. Also found that they have low transaction fees both for sending/receiving and also if you decide to stake.  News and updates on whichever currency your interesting in also. The wallet could have brighter features on the home page. I’ve noticed that the better or brighter a platform looks makes for better adoption of itself overtime. Kinda like a well dressed person or fancy car. But overall it’s a good cold wallet to use on your smartphone device.,2022-02-23 06:37:40,bullmoutainhippie,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
2,"DO NOT USE THIS WALLET!!!!!. When I first started using this wallet, I loved it. The UI is amazing, the app is super easy to use, and they support an incredible amount of different currencies(as well as, offer high APY on many of them)

I was holding a fairly low amount on the platform, at first, then slowly started to send more of a certain coin(high APY) Well, I decided that I would send some of my coins that I was considering selling for conversion. 

The transfer went really well. Incredibly smooth, appeared in a matter of seconds. The issues happened when I tried to convert said coins. I noticed a box that said there were transfer fees, which I was expecting, and I needed ETH in my wallet. So I sent ETH to my Exodus wallet. When I tried the transfer again, that same box told me I didn’t have enough to cover the conversion(I had sent over about $20 in ETH) 

The transfer and conversion fees are outrageous. After this debacle with the conversion, I tried to find another currency to convert my coin to, that wasn’t so high in fees. Every other coin I tried, had a higher minimum trade amount. Meaning my coin is being held hostage on the platform. 

I URGE EVERYONE, PLEASE, DO NOT USE THIS WALLET/PLATFORM. THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO GET THE MOST FROM THEIR PORTFOLIO.",2021-11-28 10:01:59,xxITzzMASONx,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
4,"Great Platform, but.... Exodus has an amazing user interface and decent list of supported coins. I see a lot of potential with this app compared to others I’ve tried, and I’ve tried way too many. However, their customer support isn’t great, their supported coins for Trezor is lacking, and the Apple Pay feature is a disaster. I’ve tried multiple times to get attention from customer support for issues with the Apple Pay feature and had very little success even getting a reply. If they increase the number of supported coins and get Apple Pay to work, then I’ll stay with them and quit testing out other wallets. If they don’t resolve these issues soon, then I will move on.",2021-04-22 12:54:39,danesp82,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
2,"Wait!!!!!**Read First**. This Cryptocurrency app, originally was fantastic!!! It’s still a app I use, BUT when you need to move currencies around even if it’s once a month they are charging 68% more then they should and so I’m looking at other apps that allow me to move bitcoin too and produces a new address each transaction. I didn’t think about that, so hopefully this saves you money and if you still download it well then you must not care about your money...Sorry Exodus your customer service is and was always surprisingly great but your fees are according to a small application called “Blockchain” I’m paying 68% more then I should. Anyways I hope maybe you work on that cause I think your app is top notch on every other category but fee’s.

4,"It’s a great app but….. You would need to do your research on the transaction fees and the “hidden” exchange fees. Moreover, for the portfolio side, for the users it maybe more precise to keep track of the coins and to include a “then price” because right now there is only a “now price”.

Edit V.1- Thanks to the developers to take their time to reply a review. I have seen some changes these few days on the “Now” & “Then” prices on the crypto which is a very informative feature. I hope the developers could maybe add a feature in which it shows the price when you purchase the coins. I believe with that feature, it will help a lot of new users to keep track of their books.",2021-08-20 20:12:31,Martin Andrew Lee,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
4,Great all in one app. The app seems to be very well put together. Loads quickly and can restore a wallet from other multi wallet apps. One suggestion is to integrate custom nodes on any coin as sometimes the app nodes are slow to sync. It would be nice to add custom node login for non-public nodes for more privacy to those who wish for it not just ip. Custom fees need to be added to all coins. The fee structure is not right especially for erc based tokens including ETH itself. Additionally the option to restore a supported coin by restoring from seed would be nice then users could load all of their personal wallets to the app for a true one stop shop but for now users must send coins from other wallets to Exodus.,2021-02-05 03:46:10,111111111111111112122111,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"New to crypto- easy!. After a week of researching wallets for my modest investment, finally heard a recommendation for this free wallet. I love it! It was very easy to set up. I was a little uneasy with the lack of personal info requested. Unlike all the other crypto services and exchanges  I have signed up for, this requires no ID!!! I know this is all part of the point and beauty of block-chain, but it is very counterintuitive to someone new to this whole theory! I love the ease of the interface, and the ability to see my portfolio and manipulate it easily in real time. You have a new fan! Just recommended to another newbie like myself.",2020-12-05 20:51:26,ddbreezy,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
1,"This app shuts down, or blocks us from trading. Stay away from this app!!!!!!  This app prevents users from buying currency. One minute, you can purchase it, the next minute, it’s listed as “Temporarily Unavailable,” to trade. Sometimes you will get a message saying that the currency is having connectivity issues, etc... In the meantime the currency is fluctuating in price, and you’re not able to buy in at your desired price point. Just a fair warning! Update: when the currency became available again, almost 5 days later. I didn’t have enough funds because the coin price skyrocketed, and BTC plummeted. Therefore, I needed to add more $$ just to purchase the coin. Instead, I moved to another competitor, Voyager, that allows me freedom to spend what I want without giving me a minimum to rate to buy in at.

5,"Probably the best ‘bridge’ into crypto wallets for those used to traditional banking.. One of the first wallets I tried on iOS in April ‘20, still use it to HODL a lot of coins. 
Seriously the best for HODLers. Plus the majority of newcomers unfamiliar with DeFi, liquidity pools/farming, etc. that would benefit from something they’re more accustomed to. It’s the best “bridge” for getting into crypto wallets from traditional checking/savings accounts. 
The APY being ridiculously higher than regular bank rates is what sticks out and is what makes this a great wallet to HODL coins like ADA or VET; their returns are too good to pass up. It’s a great alternative to a bank savings account",2021-09-17 09:00:30,CosmicFalls,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
1,"This wallet is a joke - avoid!!. I’m an experienced crypto holder who usually uses a hardware wallet to store my crypto, and I’ve used other mobile wallets for small crypto holdings. Didn’t use Exodus due to mixed feedback from other users, but decided to give it a try at a conference where Exodus was giving away bitcoin as a promotion to download the wallet. 

The promotional bitcoin did appear - for one day - and then disappeared the next day, never to return. The same thing happened to my friend. I’ve been emailing support for weeks now, nothing works, seed phrase restore, nothing. The bitcoin is gone. I’ve wasted more time on this issue than the promotion is worth!!  

I don’t know what’s going on at Exodus, but the tech is suspect and I have zero trust in their wallet service. This is an honest opinion about my experience, very disappointed.",2022-05-26 14:56:46,"Frustrated, do not update",Exodus,Apple App Store,us

I can’t say I like this wallet as the sending minimums are very high, I currently have close to $200 in value but I don’t have enough in either of my 2 assets to be able to transfer to an actual trading platform. I would love to send either out of my wallet to be able to reinvest in other assets. Unfortunately it will cost me a couple hundred just to meet the minimum sending limit to be able to withdraw from my wallet which with the fees associated will cost me more money. Not impressed as I never would have used Exodus as a wallet had I known that from the get go. Will update my review if the sending minimums are significantly reduced but at this point in time I can not recommend this wallet since I now have money tied up and can not do anything with it.

Constant security and UI updates let me know that they are continuously developing their product to make it better. I have had so much annoying crap happen with exchanges where I’ve had to move my money or had to jump through hoops to prove my identity in order ti withdraw funds.  With this app, I deposit my money and I have complete and total control over it. It’s so satisfying to not have some entity tell me what to do with my funds or lock them up at their own discretion without any given reason. 100% satisfied with this app.",2019-12-30 05:34:41,Bedro621,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
4,"Wish I could give 4.5 stars!. I love exodus. They have been my go to desktop wallet for many years and I use the iOS app as well. Their team is very involved, and lightning fast when you contact them for support. Over 100 coins you can store all in one place relieving the headache of having multiple wallets. I only suggest a few things. First, you don’t have access to your private keys on the iOS version, and second you cannot pick the fees in which you send transactions. It calculates them for you. And although they calculate the “best” fee to send it’s just better to have complete control.   Download this wallet if you are a crypto user and do not have a hardware wallet!",2020-05-30 14:19:55,JTDonta,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Overall: A Great Wallet. I use this as my main storage wallet for all of my coins. I hold on Robinhood also, but this app offers an easy to navigate, aesthetic pleasing, and scalable UI. I move a lot of funds with Exodus & they are always safe. The support team reaches out in sometimes 8 hours or less, and they respond promptly, and are to the point when it comes to helping you out. 

Great team. Binance, and other competitors are also incredible, but nothing beats the simplicity of Exodus for tracking and holding your assets.

Thank you Exodus for the gains & the operability. 

🗣🙏🏻

Side note: I would add to your marketing. Exodus actually allows you to buy with certain debit cards on apple pay, and the BTC shows up in less than 30 minutes. There is an untapped market in College kids, and I think some affiliation program would greatly effect the future of Exodus being s decentralized way to make micropayments to my friends and colleagues.

5,Really love it. Well I’ve been doing a deep dive on many different types of wallets I’ve tried I think a couple dozen and this one by far has been the most beautiful and well laid out in terms of the UI. When it comes to functionality I found it to be intuitive simple and highly functional. Plus with all the built-in decentralized exchanges and apps that are available and soon more apps will become available in the United States I see exit is becoming the most popular wallet. Also the integration with the Tezor is something I’m gonna be looking into,2021-05-17 20:15:19,DamionBlack,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
1,"Exchange rates are insane.. Don’t get me wrong, the platform is easy to use and intuitive which is why I decided to begin moving my crypto over there. However, after exchanging a few cryptos I discovered that I was being charged hundreds of dollars per transaction. It worked out to be over 16%. On every exchange. I caught it after the second one, but it was an expensive mistake. 
The next problem I had was when I chose to withdraw from the exchange, and instructed them to transfer ALL of each asset, they left about $40 of each asset behind. (An amount that is now apparently too small for them to transfer). So, that money is stuck there. My emails to support have been returned with generic and unhelpful responses. My best guess is that I’ve lost about $350 from by using this platform for 4 transactions.",2021-04-15 14:49:55,I like this ,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
4,"Beginning to get the Hang of it!. (Thanks for the feedback, and yes Im pretty good at things now.)Beginning to understand everything on here better. Thanks for helping to keep our crypto safe. 

Only thing Id prefer to see is a cheaper exchange instead of going to Coinbase/ Uphold/ Kraken to do them. Also, when doing an exchange it would be better to have the cost of such transaction to be shown. It seems like a hidden fee and also is pretty steep. I go from my portfolio of assets, but when I go to exchange it shows less of my actual holdings.

2,"Buying coins and converting. When I buy coins, why do I have to buy bitcoin? When I do that, I immediately lose money there. Fees supposedly covered so where did my money go?
Then when I convert to another coin like Cosmos, I lose money on that transaction as well? Again, fees supposedly covered but I don’t get $100 worth.

The $500 I spent became $480 in a matter of seconds. 

I understand fees but there was no explanation of fees, it even said fees were covered by Exodus so where did that $20 go?

I use Coinbase primarily but saw a comment on there saying the APR earned in Cosmos was double on this app and that’s why I downloaded it. 

Why can’t I buy Cosmos directly? 
Why can’t I buy directly in app? Instead it routes me to an internet browser to make my purchases?

Makes me wonder how difficult cashing out is.

I have it two stars because I’m hoping the APR really is more with this platform than it is with Coinbase. 

If I could figure out where that $20 went, or get that money back, 5 stars easy. 
It did not go from a dip in the market, that I’d understand.

3,"Eh...Meets Expectations. So far (started receiving repetitive survey requests about 12 hours after signing up), the App has been meeting expectations (which weren’t high, as I’m still learning). 

The App performs as promised and I especially appreciated all of the beginner/fundamental information that was provided for crypto newbies like myself - definitions, presentations, news articles, etc. 

However, I didn’t find the App’s layout very user friendly. The tools and views you’d think one would utilize on a daily basis are not easily found or conveniently located to one another. It’d also be nice if all of the icons had meaningful labels to provide a hint as to what their related menu options may be. 

I’m sure there’s a financial incentive behind the layout, such as making you look harder for things to eat up your time so your money sits in the accounts longer to earn interest, but If I had a choice, I’d rather pay a higher fee for a service that a provider honestly disclosed if I didn’t have to deal with the added aggravation of ads, marketing and “where’s the view to see how much money I lost/gained [Waldo]” fiasco.",2019-12-31 04:42:04,Bryan Squared,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
3,"New user. Not being a very tech savvy person. I’m having trouble setting up my account Because of massive interest, customer service is very swamped and thus has trouble responding quickly. So far I’m day 3 with trying to puzzle this app out and pushing ahead until I do. But seriously not happy if this is what everyone considers ( user friendly) because it more certainly is not user friendly No dictionary to define new terms important to users No support to quickly answer questions And no information on the different crypto currency so a person can learn what currency is and which might be purchased. Would rate this App for moderate to advanced for those who ( invest in crypto) not for new users

6months later 
Ok after using the wallet for 6 months I still stand by my original statement. But with some knowledge and having now working with 5 different wallets, I will agree the Exedus wallet is simplest to use, moderately secure.

Functionally speaking, this wallet is the best I’ve seen. The reason I haven’t given 5 stars is because you’ll need to use a portfolio manager to get more accurate/relevant information about Crypto and your gains/losses. 

Download this wallet and connect it to a portfolio manager if you plan to hodl or exchange coins that aren’t on bull run. If you expect to find an exchange or wallet with lighting fast transaction speeds in the US, then you probably came here to wind a wallet to store your DOGE in, and you should probably do some more research.",2021-04-14 11:13:39,Peroxus,Exodus,Apple App Store,us

1,"DO NOT USE! Bitcoin jail!. I deposited a small amount of Bitcoin just to earn some interest while holding. When it came Time to withdraw that Bitcoin is when the issues started. You have to have a minimum amount of Bitcoin deposited before you can withdraw. So I had to deposit more Bitcoin paying high gas fees just to withdraw what I had in. The deposit time takes 30 min+ I think mine took about an hour.  Any other exchanges are near instant.

Then after submitting my withdrawal it was flagged for further review which took them almost a day to notify me. I had to fill out a form giving them a picture of my Drivers license and then for them to tell me it could take another 3 business days to approve. Again any other exchange is near instant.

The aspect of having control over your wallet, being able to sync your mobile wallet with your desktop wallet(and vice versa), and the vast array of crypto you can store in the wallet are all things I love. However it’s very frustrating to not be able to set your own network and mining fee with the application. When leaving it up to the Exodus algorithm, it calculates how much you should pay in fees to ensure your transaction is almost instant. Which can be costly. Causing me to spend $600 purchasing crypto, only end up with $400 after fees.
