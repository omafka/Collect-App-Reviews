4,"Great app. So far I am very new to this app, however from what I‚Äôve experienced, most of the negative reviews are from beginners that did not take the time to read and understand what they were getting themselves into. I currently have the jade green card and I can say that I have already received my Netflix rebate so that works. I have not tried to withdraw my funds yet as I‚Äôm waiting on my money to transfer so I can test everything, however I have spend money with the virtual card and got my money back in cro that way as well. So far it has done everything it should. Also, I have experienced one problem with my card info not displaying on one of my devices however the customer support has been great and they are working on it. If you find yourself with that problem, I would recommend trying a different device if possible. In the end customer support has been kind and respectful and if you take the time to understand the fees that this app should help you earn some serious cash. In the end, just do test payments and be 100% sure of what should happen and be patient. I just hope that they get a website working and one point, other than that I am happy with what I have :)",2021-08-25 19:03:14,$cashguy$,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
5,"Wonderful Crypto App Review Rating. I was so dissatisfied to carry out necessary probing but i really wanted to leap on the crypto trading and investment aim. Unfortunately for me, I invested 53,450 GBP worth of bitcoin with a fraudulent company. I was delighted to observe my account increase to 230,200 GBP within a couple of weeks. But i didn‚Äôt realize i was dealing with a diddle company, until i tried to make an attempt to withdraw. I made a withdrawal request, and noticed my account was suddenly blocked for no apparent reason. I tried contacting their customer support, but all to no avail. I needed my money back at all cost, because i could not afford to let it go. So i tried all possible means to make sure i recovered my scammed bitcoin. I did a lot of online search for help, and tried to see if there were other people who had any similar experience. I stumbled upon a cryptocurrency forum were a couple of people mentioned that they had been through the same process but were able to recover their lost cryptocurrency, funds with the help of Alexcybertech01 at gmailcom. So i file a report and he was able to help me get back all my lost funds within 1 week i feel indebted to him.

Since crypto coins can be traded both inside and outside the digital currency environment, digital currencies are more than just a way to pay for goods and services ‚Äì they are a viable investment opportunity that OneStepCryptoInvest (at) Gmail com has made possible.

1,"Doesn‚Äôt allow you to buy crypto after a while using the app.. I‚Äôve been using the app for about 6 months now and was actually enjoying it. But for the past week I have been trying to buy different crypto and everytime I try, it never goes through. There is always a blank white page after trying to buy anything. Sometimes in will say there is an error that occurred. So I contacted the app through the chat and they could not help me at all. The help chat is completely useless in this issue. I asked if there was a number to call but the chat doesn‚Äôt help you with that either. Then I figured maybe it‚Äôs my bank that is not letting the transaction happen but I called my bank and they said they haven‚Äôt stopped anything or seen any attempts to buy crypto from the app. Today I tried to delete my card information from the app and then re enter my card information to buy some crypto to see if that would make it work. To my surprise the error occurred did not pop up this time but instead the app says that my card issuer declined the transaction and to call my bank to fix the issue. Well I did call them again to see if now they where declining it and they told me again there was no attempt to buy any crypto from the app. My bank didn‚Äôt decline anything. So the app is just falsely accusing that my bank declined it. This app has to many bugs and when you need help for anything there isn‚Äôt anyone to actually talk to.

1,"Investors beware. This app started great, it has many good features like the airtime pay for cellphone service that you can use with the Crypto that your holding. The downfall happened to me recently after securing the account with 2fa. In the beginning of the account security it was great, transfer went smooth, but then there was a attack on CRYPTO last month that caused some disturbances resulting in a 2fa reset forcing certain users to apply this change. Since this was done for me already it didn‚Äôt bother me until I went to transfer funds to discover the 2fa was not accurate. This is where the problem started. I contacted customer service and the bot spat out a inaccurate solution resulting in me texting a random agent that request that I submit a video for ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù reasons. After providing said video, it was not good enough, so I have to change email address to ‚Äúsecure‚Äù the account. I thought it was over until I get another email saying ‚Äúhe he hee‚Äù we need another video of glycine hiding a ransom sign. Now the crypto card I have is frozen and this is still a ongoing issue.

Update: In order to Get back into the account I had to literally submit 8 MORE VIDEOS!!! Keep in mind that it‚Äôs in a UNSECURE EMAIL, which means your identity will be compromised by another party to be used without your knowledge. This is a Major concern of mine and with the current trend I‚Äôm not sure if I will be victimized by this FORCED ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù policy.

1,"DO NOT download or put money in this app!. I‚Äôm an Admin in a trading group and we all share different ideas and alert each other of apps that steal your money.  This APP is horrible!!!!  On this app I had most of my money in ALGO (Algorand).  It took a nice 20% increase and I went to go take the profits and move them to CRO.  MAGICALLY my ability to trade was stopped!  I contacted them, took screen shots,  let them know what was going on and that I was losing my profits by the second‚Ä¶.  They responded saying it would be fixed later.  Not ‚Äúlet us trade it where you need it or anything of the sort‚Äù. They waited until it dropped all the way down to what I bought it at!  Then had the audacity to say, and I quote ‚Äù. Thanks for the reply. I totally understand, however, the issue was resolved and you were able to withdraw the funds.
If you have additional questions do not hesitate to get back to us.‚Äù   They basically said screw you the same way Robin Hood app does. Scams.   COINBASE and COINBASE PRO is the way to go.  DO NOT GET SCAMMED WHEN YOU SHOULD BE MAKING MONEY!  Again, do not use this app.  Buy rates are always off compared to the actual market and always in their favor.  They say on these reviews ‚Äúcontact us and we‚Äôll look into it‚Äù but they just blow you off once they scam you.

2,"Not too happy. At the beginning, I was happy with this app it is a nice app in the sense that you can earn additional income from owning the different crypto assets. The only issue and the biggest issue that I have is that when I try to make purchases with my debit card, it‚Äôs a hit and miss and more often than not It is a miss. When I try to make a purchase some of the times it will go through most of the times it doesn‚Äôt go through and the issue is not my bank it is the application. I tried to go through their customer service, but their best advice was to transfer money to the application. What if I don‚Äôt want to transfer money, I want to use my debit card so I can purchased the crypto as I go along. Also,If you have a customer that is telling you there‚Äôs an issue with a certain part of the application why not try to resolve the issue instead of telling them to not use that part of the application and do their purchases a different way. Overall, yes I do like the application, but I get frustrated very often with it because of the fact that I cannot make my purchases that easily. When I started using the application, all my purchases were going through nice and easy but now I do not know what it is that they did and it is just not that easy.

5,"Fantastic Platform!. Do all of your DD before diving into digital currency. This platform is fantastic for both beginners and veterans alike. There are many benefits baked in and from my experience, Once I‚Äôve initiated an ACH transfer from my personal account, I‚Äôve had access to the funds within 24 hours, in my Crypto account. That is a huge deal. I‚Äôve used Other platforms where transfers have taken 3 days to complete, and up to nearly 3 weeks. Hoo-rah to this team for creating a quick process, among all the other benefits of their platform!!! One suggestion - I don‚Äôt believe any of these platforms have utilized yet - Y‚Äôall should integrate a way for users to buy crypto with their ‚ÄúApple‚Äù balance or Apple gift cards. If I were to receive a gift card, other than shopping, I can‚Äôt convert the balance into fiat, but it‚Äôd be wonderful to sink that balance or gift card into CRO, ETH, SHIB, etc‚Ä¶ When a user initiates a buy order, the app gives about 12 seconds to confirm, I believe that‚Äôs because of price fluctuation. I wonder if the same concept could be used to buy increments of altcoins - i.e. $20 for 20 worth of CRO‚Ä¶ ? Either way, great job, keep it going, and hoo-rah!

With that being said I am still learning but I have also experienced a whole lot with some hard learned lessons in that year as well. Okay, so I looked up all these other exchanges binance, Coinbase, robinghood etc etc. i had tons of difficulties until I found cryptoapp. I found this app very simple to use and not confusing buy and sell transfer simple. And I also found that the customer service was always there to help and quick with responses and all of my issues were resolved. However in the las week I have noticed that I am not able to top up my card with the same debit card I have been using this whole time and cryptodotcom cannot help me out just tells me to use a different card so I did and yeah exactly, still unable reached back out and they don‚Äôt know and can‚Äôt help. So then I tried to make a purchase and yeah same issue and yeah they cannot help. And I am also seeing others on social media are having the same issue.

How this platform helped me in understanding more about cryptocurrency it was really useful after some time I needed to recover my stolen cryptocurrency coins and tokens from telegram scammers: People all across the world are hearing about the quick profits that early Bitcoin and other coin investors are making and want to get in on the action. But be aware that where there is big money, there are other companies who are abusing and exploiting the situation. In my case, a phoney telegram group admin contacted me and sent me a phishing link with my 12-character recovery phrase.

4,"Great for new users. Been using app for about 8 months, easy to use, you do get harassed with proving your income, way beyond reason, in to things that is frankly none of there business, wife closed her account as a result.  Also it‚Äôs said buying at true cost, but the fees hidden on exchange from trading a coin. Was not easy to find costs ahead of time for me at least. It is easy on and off for through ACH with Chase bank, had trouble with 2 other smaller banks limited to 1k and 5k transfers, chase allows 25k, once I did a withdrawal and had no issue. They just now opened up US to use a separate program to exchange tokens ( coins), so should be less expensive fees in trading and remember you will pay transfer fees to other crypto wallets ( called gas fees), but the coins moved dictate the amount, due your research before trading to check tax consequences for each and every transaction, can be a nightmare! I gave app 4 stars, over all better that Coinbase as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Look at there debit card choices, nice options and rewards. Other features are nice like staking stable coins, however they just announced a reduction in interest in staking those.

4,"Great service but..... There service is great. Very easy or somewhat easy to navigate, it took me a little while to understand everything, but now I get it. I was able to deposit money on my Crypto account from my debit card pretty smoothly. Taking money out is pretty straight forward as long as your bank is on the list of compatible banks (which are big name banks and credit unions) I have a very small credit union so I had to open a bank account that was on that list. Pretty common with most app involving bank linking. The only thing I would like to be improved is faster customer service. They will always help you and resolve your issues but you just got to have patience. I understand because of the increased interest in Crypto which increases customers which inevitably increases issues. That being said...customer service response time: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è. customer service helpfulness/problem resolution ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

5,"If you‚Äôre looking for ‚Äúthe One,‚Äù this is it.. Out of all the Crypto exchanges out there, this is the one that clearly stands out due to their professionalism and consistent high-quality experiences to include this app. Over the last few years I have done business with several Centralized Exchanges and this one happens to be my favorite due to their privacy practices, stable experiences and tight customer service. If ever I had a question related to my investments they were quick to answer. Not only that, they have taken proactive steps to ensuring secure practices. With all of that said I would also highly-recommend that anyone reading this review to also consider a ‚Äúcold storage‚Äù solution if they want even more control and security over their investments. Also, seriously do your homework in this space as there is a lot to learn and‚Äîat times‚Äîperil.

1,"Outstanding crypto exchange rating. If you have been looking for the best fund retrieval firm that can help you recover your stolen assets. I need to share this in here so you won‚Äôt lose your money cheaply to scam brokers. I invested about $367,000 USDT on a binary option platform then I decided to withdraw after several weeks but the withdrawal wasn‚Äôt successful, then I tried to contact the platform via email and phone number, I didn‚Äôt get a response from them that was when everything started looking weird. Some weeks later I got a mail from them insisting I should invest more money if I want to withdraw my money which I rejected, and I never hear from them again that was when I knew I had been scammed. I was really devastated at those moment and felt so bad that my hard earned money was gone. After some months I came across a lot of testimonies on the web how Alexcybertech01@gmailcom had helped many people recovered their stolen, scammed or duped money on crypto ,i contacted them and they promised to help me get my money back asked me some info about the scammer which I provided.

5,"Most fun I've ever had getting rich. Turning a few hundred bucks into tens of thousands, even while I'm sleeping is the most fun I've erer had buying stuff!  I've heard my whole life ""pay yourself first"" but that amounted to impulse buys for more junk I simply don't need, burying me in useless detritus I can never find when I need it 'cause it's buried under other just as useless rubble!  Buying crypto gives me that endorphin hit I desire without increasing the amount of stuff soffocating my very existence.  It's also hitting that betting urge and at much better odds then any casino.  Advice,  buy for the long term, only spend free money that you would've wasted on something mundane.  I started by buying 20,000 shares of VET @.02 cents ea. It's now at about,07, buts been as high as .11, I have no doubt that future readers of this review will look back on these figures and wish they bought in while it was so undervalued.

Don‚Äôt fall into the trap too of getting one of their cards because they can slash those rates overnight (as they did) and then ‚Äúupgrade it‚Äù slightly to make it seem like they‚Äôre doing you a favor lol look up some of their Reddit forums and you‚Äôll see how much of the community, especially a lot of their older loyal investors, have been screwed over lately. You can‚Äôt trust these guys because they don‚Äôt communicate ANY changes they‚Äôre going to make. Or if they do by chance, they‚Äôll enact it days before the announced date just to throw everyone for a loop and screw them up that way. The only people who will try to convince you that CDC is still good are the people who invested more than they can afford to lose in CRO (their crypto). They‚Äôre afraid if CDC goes down, CRO will go down and they‚Äôll lose money. My advice is to use coinbase instead. Never had any problems with them.

3,"Good and bad. I really like using this app to trade cryptos because it is fast and has great coverage of many coins out there. I think it is shady that there‚Äôs a magic ‚Äúpremium‚Äù added to coins when BTC is rising, and this is a money grab in my opinion because that premium is not applied when you sell. For example, CRO was .1210 when I tried to buy, and after doing the math (which is not provided because they know it‚Äôs shady) my average cost was somewhere around .125. Not a huge difference but that is hard earned profit by this point. I have been trying to get my CRO card for weeks now and I have been told that the only way I can continue with my application is to provide a picture of my SSN card. This was due to me moving addresses multiple times in the past few years because I am a college student. It is very frustrating and the support, albeit responds in a timely manner, does not seem like they really want to get you to your end goal. With all that said, I still trade here and love checking in on my cryptos.

Loosing ones Crypto currency can be a devastating thing to experience, the fact that it is almost impossible to recover a Stolen or lost Crypto coin hurt more than anything. When a person get scammed of their money while investing in a crypto currency platform the only thing they can think of is how to report the company and get back their money. Most victims of the scam contact their wallet account provider, their bank or the law enforcement, a few end up hiring a lawyer to sue the company but after all these stress they still cant get their money back. Please everyone should be careful where they invest their money. Bitcoin has made many rich and at the same time made so many broke and desperate.

1,"Slow, glitchy, and mild scamming. First off im in the US, which means this app offers a lot that many here don't.
The issue is that the app is almost unusable. If anyone says this app is easy, they were lucky or lying. Banks consider it a scam, so just getting past that is a pain, but even if you do the app has an extreme chance of just glitching. Then if you do manage to begin trading there can be serious delays of over a week making it difficult to make time sensitive decisions. Lastly is what i consider to be mild scamming regarding transfers. Transferring into the app was very easy... Transferring out after being disappointed was obviously set up to be difficult. Setting up transfers is extremely glitchy and made me have to write down addresses manually because the app would glitch every time i went to copy one. Also with minimum limits far higher than the ones set for transferring in, i literally couldn't take out what i put in. Lastly the app is just simply slower and clunkier than any other crypto app ive found.

Small time funds will always be locked unlike many other exchanges with much lower, usually 0.001, or with Gemini, 0. If you‚Äôre using this to invest small time money of DCA I highly recommend turning away. This app has a $20 withdraw fee at .0004btc to move it to any more secure wallets. Their 2fa bugged out and I had to reset it. I had to spend over 4 days sending and buying funds to get enough btc to finally withdraw just to discover there‚Äôs a $20 withdraw fee. Every other exchange I can think of has fees so small they‚Äôre still under $10 when moving thousands. Half of this bad experience is due to my negligence of not researching withdraw mins and fees.

I wanted to highlight the notifications issue that's annoying so much. For the cryptos you track when you receive notifications abt price changes it's totally incorrect for the time. Price u see in notification and what you see after you tap to open are totally different. Not just by a fraction but by so many percentages.

4,Okay I‚Äôm doing a new review.. I‚Äôm only giving four stars because you really need to do your homework to learn about prices. The coins themselves have different sale % that come off the top. Crypto itself has no fees for buying/a unless you‚Äôre using your debit/ccard. However you need to learn the sale percentages of the coins. The price reflected on the graph daily is not the actual price. That‚Äôs the buy price. What I do is use the Binance app for the real price so that I‚Äôm not ticked off when I sell and find it‚Äôs $20 to sell when actually they‚Äôre reasonable. Setting up a bank account requires specific banks. Make sure yours is on the list. Once you get the hang of the fiat wallet and your buy/sale percentages it really is a great up. Set all your financial stuff up and get your bank account squared away before you buy anything. Get secure with how to get your money back into your pocket. Easy to use. Highly recommended.,2021-09-03 02:49:48,theOtherWB,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us
1,"Horrible Experience!!! Do Not Trust - READ FIRST. I would NEVER recommend this app to anyone looking to invest their hard-earned money into crypto! After NUMEROUS ‚Äúmessaging conversations,‚Äù I‚Äôve been left feeling completely helpless after receiving computer generated responses and not once being offered addl help in resolving the issue - or the $25 I was promised for signing up. 
After trying multiple different types of payment methods from debit to credit cards and being unsuccessful at every turn, I don‚Äôt have so much as a customer service number to call and speak to anyone about this. I‚Äôve spoken to my banks multiple times and after asking several times for a customer service number during these message conversations, I have yet to receive a number or response regarding my question. It‚Äôs been a 3-day process and I have yet to be able to invest a single dollar because of this flawed system. 
If you‚Äôre looking to invest in the ‚Äúnear-future‚Äù and don‚Äôt mind being left helplessly in the dark, this may be the place for you, if not, and you‚Äôre looking to hop the train sooner than later, I'd look elsewhere.",2022-02-12 01:24:23,Se√±or T.,Crypto.com,Apple App Store,us

This amazing app makes crypto incredibly easy‚Ä¶even as a first timer ..it is well detailed and a great customer service,I will continually use this app.. thumbs up!.though many people have fallen victim of fake crypto apps but I found out about this Agency that provides services to victims of cryptocurrency scam or cheated on the internet. I engaged them to please help in recovering of my Cryptocurrency tokens/funds of about $45,560 from a Forex company that scammed me, CryptoFx to be precised. Their recovery specialist by the name of Hackermanisoc assisted me step by step and we worked together and without doubt I was actually amazed with how he assisted me to recover my funds from the Scammers . In conclusion, I'd say the agency were helpful and worked very friendly and also professionally at the same time during the course.

2,"I really wanted to love this this app but‚Ä¶. I was excited because the app has a good user interface and most of the coins/tokens I wanted are available. I was also drawn to the high staking rewards. I was especially excited to see that you can buy with a CC or Debit card. 

Unfortunately many features on the app just did not work for me.. was unable to purchase with a Credit Card (tried several times with two cards.. I even tried on different days. I just got a blank empty screen.. I called my bank, but they had no record of the attempts) the app will frequently freeze up and I had to attempt my first few purchases multiple times because the price would update.. this is fine, except it would kick me all the way back to the Home Screen and make me start over. I‚Äôm on an iPhone 12 Pro less than a year old..

I have yet to receive my card, but that‚Äôs because I live in the US and they just started shipping. If you want to take advantage of every aspect of crypto, this app is all around for you. It‚Äôs a multi purpose crypto wallet with the feel of a large bank! One thing I do think they need is a desktop platform.. so far they‚Äôre in the number one spot for the market they target, but imo a desktop version would give them a significant advantage over their competitors. As far seeing the bad reviews on here... working in business myself, reading the negative reviews then using the app.. I can say in full confidence that the negative reviews are due to user error lol regardless, give this app a chance! It won‚Äôt disappoint.

The app itself will not let you take money out unless you withdraw 100 dollars at once. They said they cannot help me unless I were to put more money in, wait for it to transfer and then withdraw it out once I reach the threshold. I do not need to be working on my masters in cyber security to comprehend how a legitimate business would ever tell a customer to just give them deposit money to receive money back. Please be extremely careful and do your research before making investments when using shady and up and coming applications. I am writing a report for my class about fraudulent online storefronts and I am referencing this app in particular. The customer service was very vague when asking particular questions about security concerns. I am hesitant to call it a scam outright but I do not feel comfortable depositing more money into the app to revive my current balance. That should speak volumes to new customers.

1,"Updated review: more pathetic than I first thought. Because my bank isn‚Äôt listed on Plaid, I have literally no way to withdraw my money. I could, however, very easily deposit money with a debit card. That‚Äôs pretty fishy.

UPDATE: I bought coins with my credit card, didn‚Äôt receive my coins yet my cc was charged. If I trade my coins, they go to some unknown location and I can‚Äôt do anything with them and I lose money while while the app freezes. If I buy coins- again it doesn‚Äôt show and my coins are off in la la land not making money. I don‚Äôt even have access to my money and I can‚Äôt buy when prices are good. This app is HORRIBLE. I have lost so much freaking money not being able to sell when I want and not being able to buy with my own funds that are already in the app.  If you can‚Äôt handle the traffic that comes with adding Shib, don‚Äôt add it. Terrible. F- As soon as this stupid platform stops glitching, and I get paid back what was stolen from me, I am taking every penny out of this app and telling everyone not to use it!!

Stay FAR away from this app. Im currently seeking legal action against this one for holding my money hostage.

This is the single most dishonest company ive ever encountered and urge you NOT to download this app. Hope this app gets pulled from the App Store bc its basically designed to never let users access actual money. They have designed a process that will never allow users to access funds once they‚Äôve been deposited. So, even if you make tons of money off crypto...they‚Äôll never let you actually get your hands on it! You wouldn‚Äôt believe the excuses I‚Äôve been given.

For 2 months now I have been trying to contact cryptohousetech but I got no response. I talked to my friends and colleagues about it and luckily for me a friend of mine just got out of a situation like that and introduced to a wealth recovery team that helped her during her investment problem, within 3 days of contacting them they were able to help me get 100% of my lost money back.

1,"The worst crypto app I have ever used. I cannot believe the ordeal I have been through with this company. I have used 4 other crypto apps and I cannot believe how clunky and buggy this app is. I transferred money to my account, then I could not sell or transfer my money for one whole month. Then I had to talk to customer support and send them bank statements showing that I indeed transferred money from my bank to their app, and then magically only then could I see the interface to transfer my money out of the platform. 

But low and behold, I cannot actually complete the transfer because the app freezes as soon as I click ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù to transfer my money out. Then I contact customer service again and they are asking for more ridiculous things. I don‚Äôt understand how I have to keep contacting customer service to trade my stocks and transfer my money.

First of all, if you haven‚Äôt used Binance yet make sure to enter the reward coupon MTPDHCLV on the sign up screen to get 40% commission kickback rate. Wonderful... The best trading app ever. Very fast and reliable. God! Your app rock. I mean no change for trading and you can trade so many coin at the same time. Wow! With every update from past 4-5 months, the app has just got sleeker and sleeker. Both buy and sell interface are now on same page to make things more eaiser i recommend this app. The fees are reasonable if you use BNB to cover your fees for trading, Binance cuts fees down 50% if you use BNB, the fees go down more depending on what ""tier"" or level user you are. Pricing is real time, sending and receiving crypto is quick. Their security is incredible, the level of security used to protect the user account is one of the best. They now offer a virtual wallet, and the support team is quick to help if you need them. One recommendations - In trades (center) tab when we click on the open trades icon, the history is out at the top right which isn't quite an ideal position. Do what you've done for futures open orders and order history, just slide right to get the order history. That would be really neat... All bug with new upload are fixed!!

Most victims of the scam contact their wallet account provider, their bank or the law enforcement, a few end up hiring a lawyer to sue the company but after all these stress they still cant get their money back.

4,"Cluttered GUI. The exchanges GUI is cluttered. I end up touching something I didn‚Äôt mean to touch because all the buttons are close to each other. I understand they want this to be user friendly by placing everything in the open so nothing is hidden but it just makes everything messy. Add menus and you can free up space on the GUI. It‚Äôs hard increasing and decreasing price of coins we are selling in the exchange without hitting something else and causing the screen to swipe. Same goes for the amount buttons to increase and decrease the amount of coins we are selling and buying in the exchange screen. 

Also id like to be able to see market/price history on the buy/sell screen so I can see how much a coin was being sold for last month as I‚Äôm pricing it for selling without having to change screens and go to the other market tab to engage prices. 

Oh and most importantly there should be a note when selling coins that there‚Äôs a bare minimum of .1 before we go to sell our coins. I wasted time setting up a coin to sell just to find out afterwards I didn‚Äôt have enough coins to sell which wasted minutes of my time. So minimums and other rules should be made visible at all times.

The app was a well deserved 5 star rating but now it is not as helpful as it was. 
Even on stochastic indicators, trend lines and cursor could be dragged over to see values of RSI, KDJ and so on easily, user-friendly like no other app.

Now we are to the point they are asking me for multiple IDs, and recording a VIDEO of myself showing the date and IDs and myself logged into the page and they STILL are responding back saying things like ‚Äúoh you didn‚Äôt say this right‚Äù and ‚Äúyou need to also video your withdrawal history‚Äù (which doesn‚Äôt exist because they won‚Äôt let me withdraw‚Äù.

4,"Recent performance slowdown. I love binance for buying/selling crypto. However, a couple updates back i noticed a sudden change in performance when you enter trade charts, open the buy/sell menu, and leave trading charts in particular where the app consistently stalls for a one or two second period before the action is carried out. This used to not happen and makes it difficult to quickly switch between trades and buy or sell on mobile. These used to happen almost instantly. It would be really helpful if this delay could be sorted out. I‚Äôve had to resort to the website for these actions because this delay makes quick trading decisions impossible during busy market movements.",2021-08-14 06:39:35,Comander fox,Binance,Apple App Store,us
1,"One of the most useless crypto app ever. Cryptocurrencies might be Binance‚Äôs game, they might actually be fairly good at it (have yet to get hacked to the point of shutting down; owner have not run off with investors crypto assets). But the entire registration and verification process is broken as F___! And from the family and friends that told me their personal experiences about Binance, I can keep trying (to infinity) or give up.  Binance is that bad, at least with ID verification and proof of address, etc.  the advice is to keep trying, uploading the same PDF document and with any luck, 6 months later, it will magically get approved.

I supposed it could be a Robinhood app, and Binance will disrupt trading, force liquidate positions, just because they are undercapitalized and think they can do it without legal and civil ramifications. 

Oh, the Binance mobile app and their website can‚Äôt agree on my login credentials either. At first I thought I downloaded the wrong app and my login is actually being sent to the database of a phishing con artist. Luckily it is just horrible UI, flawed end user usability issue, that even a novice Software QA tester can identify and document for a high priority bug fix report.

5,"Wonderful review in app ‚úÖ. When searching for the best cryptocurrency wallet to keep your cryptocurrencies, one very important thing that comes to the mind is reliability and flexibility of the app due to the variety of options that could be explored in cryptocurrency trading and investment. One core value is the assurance that your cryptocurrency is safe as market prices fluctuate. I've made use of some crypto apps in the past that are not as flexible and reliable just as I need them, but I've been able to enjoy the features of this app. Ordinarily, I get conscious of using wallets or apps I'll get to deposit money from my bank account ever since my wallet with over $150k was hijacked and all my coins got lost. My profound gratitude forever goes to Hackerflyhubs @ gmail , who successfully recovered my coins for me immediately after I came across their contact and hired these experts. I felt so delighted. Little did I know this recovery professionals and tech experts have helped several Europeans recover their lost bitcoins and still working effectively until I got their astonishing service through their contact/support team email hackerflyhubs @ gmail You can also contact them for any crypto issues tech support such as lost bitcoins recovery or any other crypto recovery and thank me later for this review.",2022-10-18 19:14:35,ELLA B2$2,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us
5,"Best kucoin wonderful app review. Today Bitcoin is more than just an asset, Bitcoin has been 100x better investment than anything else in the past 10 years, you can Google it yourself. Bitcoin is both a currency and technology, and only a few people understand how to maximize profits and huge returns in a short period of time. I was fortunate to meet Expert Donaldcyberlord and cryptocurrency expert on a Bitcoin blog online. I contacted him for guidance, we talked for a while and I did subscribe to their bitcoin investment/mining program, believe it or not he made me $490,050 in just 6 weeks and I was very much impressed at his skills, and I only started with a small amount. Before I met him, I was a bit careless with security features strong passwords earlier when I started up on Coinbase and was hacked with almost 8 bitcoin stolen from my wallet, when I told him about it, he just requested for details of hacked transaction in my wallet and all transaction details, he traced the hackers wallet addresses they moved my coins to and extracted all my coins back from the blockchain network in just 48 hours. I had a bet with him that if he could truly get back my coins I would let the world know about him. You can drop him a mail at, cryptoshades@Gmail.

Do not listen to the FUD you read here in the reviews, yes they were hacked back in 2020, but have since remitted every penny and then some with insurance and restitution money.

I did everything they said to do and it still does not work I still can‚Äôt check my bot keeps saying timed out . I can‚Äôt even send feedback won‚Äôt let me and customer service takes forever.

1,"Trading on this app is a scam. I consider myself an avid trader who knows what they‚Äôre doing. But Kucoin will destroy any hope you have. When trading futures, it feels like my trades specifically are picked and wiped out and then immediately trend the direction I bet on. When I place a limit order, I can see the price start to fluctuate as soon as I type an order that would be fulfilled in my favor. I have placed opposite sided trades on a second device and BOTH sides were SHORTED on a volume of maybe 100 coins of a sub dollar coin within 15 minutes. I have screen recorded trading showing how the app practically tracks my inputs since they also know my exact percentages and what it would take to wipe out a trade. The trading bot is also worthless. You pay more in GRID gains than you make no matter how you set it up, and the bots also contribute to the problem with futures. 

Stay away from this horrible trading app. You can only make money holding (unless they take your coin off the market then your holdings are gone too), which I also bet they use to manipulate prices when you‚Äôre not using. That‚Äôs what staking off chain is as well, hence the lower apr you get.",2021-02-10 12:30:28,AndrewLeeWoolard,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us

I also set a stop loss and it doesn‚Äôt trigger until the actual price gets there but market price will be 10 or more dollars passed that so instead of the price I actually selected to lose I lose way more than I actually wanted to which is absolutely stupid and a scam!

But Kucoin is beginning to severely worry me. This is a trading app, not a HODLing app. 
Therefor you need to be able to trade. Kucoin has started crashing at very crucial times. I lost over 30% of my portfolio because I tried to initiate a sell and Kucoin‚Äôs network went down for the 6th time that week because it got a little busy and had to do it‚Äôs job a little harder. poof. gone.  6 months of savings and trading gone in 20 minutes, not from a bad trade. It was an excellent trade. Kucoin just couldn‚Äôt follow-through. 
People are putting their faith in crypto currency because they are sick of banks and conglomerates incompetence and greed losing their money for them. I‚Äôm those 20 minutes. Everything is up to date. Kucoin simply is failing when it gets busy and people are losing 10s of thousands as a result. 
Kucoin- fix your problems immediately.

These experiences have left a terrible taste in my mouth and I can‚Äôt help but think the creators are pulling a fast one. I have lost over $3,000 because of my experiences using this application. (All of my other trading platforms would work perfectly during these described issues and I was able to execute perfect trades on every other platform I utilize) so they cannot claim it is my own personal network.

Also when using futures, it‚Äôs takes a while to submits orders, and sometimes the position disappears for few seconds until close out the app or refresh.

1- customer support‚Ä¶ it is very hard to get thru and get a prompt reply
2- fiat ‚Ä¶ if there‚Äôs a way KuCoin can set up the ability to accept fiat currency without the confusing and expensive option they recently added this would bring more users to the platform

2,"Good but not great. This app/platform all around is pretty amazing and by far the most advanced of its kind. BUT there has been numerous situations including the most recent leading me to leave a negative review. KuCoin buy/sell/market orders will sometimes not complete or go through. This requires you to refresh the app, wasting time in between your trades. What is the point of trading on an app where I have to refresh one to several times before I can make my trade. Lost thousands from this issue I am describing, and each time it pushes me closer towards finding an alternative exchange that doesn‚Äôt require manual refreshing while trading positions. There are lots of bots and manipulation within this app, and I‚Äôm growing more weary of it by the day.

1,"Don‚Äôt use. Kucoin needs to get shut down by some agency in the US.. everything is done to get you liquidated.

From my average cost to the lowest low on the futures pair, it should have never been liquidated (20x on -2.4% from average cost does not equal 100%). It is about time somebody goes after Kucoin in the US.

This has been a problem for me the whole time using Kucoin. Lost tens of thousands because of this and their ‚Äúrandom‚Äù log out event that occurs when market tanks.

However, questionable ethics and customer support. At some point in time, their software will malfunction(this is definite). When this happens, you‚Äôll contact support, and then they‚Äôll have made a maintenance post after the fact. I know this to be true because after the first time. I always started checking their news feed(not like you should receive a direct notification, and a reminder), this happened multiple other times and support will always just reply with the post that was after the fact. 

So, you‚Äôre out of a considerable sum; your trading volume is consistently 100k+ a month; you‚Äôd think that they‚Äôd be happy to make things right. No, the support people are glorified FAQ‚Äôs. They‚Äôll send your info off to another team. That team will not read anything and respond something that‚Äôs not even relevant to the issue at hand. You‚Äôll reply to said email because it‚Äôs a support conversation. They‚Äôll never respond a second time. They will never fix problems they create.

Used the same funding account every time to load USDT.  (Speaking of USDT when I was referred as a new user, I tried to get the sign up bonus but their wording is/was purposely confusing.   I say purposely because I pointed out the grammatical errors and they just ignored me)

Anyway‚Ä¶ yeah at first I was having to pay exorbitant fees to load USDT via 3rd party, then they finally verified me and it was 1.02 which was nice.

Then, out of the blue, I go to load $200 via same payment source as before, at same internet IP I always use, and it says ‚Äúfor your safety your trade has been canceled‚Äù.  I ask support and they say try a new bank card.   Grrr.   Went to my bank and got a new card.  And voila!! It still does the same thing.

So many great features, I never write reviews but this app made me want to. I believe Kucoin will be very popular in a year or 2",2021-03-20 17:25:36,Mave119911,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us
2,"Crypto in general a horrible investment. Kucoin is probably one of the better exchanges  out there. Their futures allow for an actual proper stop loss and take profit which is essential if you ever want to be a successful trader. HOWEVER. Trading crypto is by far the worst thing you can do for trying to become profitable. Low liquidity and ABYSMAL market structure you will never be able to constantly trade. I hope this will save someone out there from making horrible financial decisions and if you want to trade, find an index or precious metal to trade. You will be WAY better off.",2022-08-11 09:18:15,Dylan1234567891011121314,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us
2,Worst redesign I‚Äôve seen. The previous version of your app was complicated and had a learning curve but it was still useful. The new version your app lacks basic utility. I don‚Äôt know to do basic tasks and you‚Äôve instead focused the app on useless and unwanted features. I highly recommend you do some UX research studies with newer crypto investors to improve the product if that is your goal. The only reason I‚Äôm giving 2 stars is because you left the option for me to go back to the old interface (oddly hidden within a random emoji)?!,2022-02-11 10:56:35,Anomster,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us
1,"Auto logout 14-30 times per day. This app is very good. But the only problem is it‚Äôs automatically log me out 14-30 times a day. Even I don‚Äôt use vpn. Very disturbing on every times. Please fix the issues. Also P2P messaging option not good. Never sending notifications. Please fix this and I will change my review

Updated: 
As per your instructions I deleted kucoin app then installed again. Same problem exist.  Also if I use vpn then it‚Äôs seem logout when I close app and open. 
Very frustrating. My phone is iphone 11. I tried other apps like binance.  The auto logout problem is not happening.",2022-05-28 16:18:15,irfan-hossain,KuCoin,Apple App Store,us

The representatives from KuCoin on the chat never offered any remedy and just keep telling me to patiently wait. They don‚Äôt offer to reach out by email or anything. Speaking of email... I wasn‚Äôt even notified of the security incident by email or that I can‚Äôt use their deposit or withdrawal services.

1,Not functioning as intended.. I can‚Äôt complete any verification on this app since it won‚Äôt sent out codes. Tried with several numbers. All of which are actual phone lines and not voip but still nothing. I transferred in some doge coin but now I can‚Äôt do anything with it including transfer out. It‚Äôs more like a vault. A vault you will never have access to than a wallet.,2022-09-25 23:41:41,JustRickyJoe,OWNR Digital Wallet,Apple App Store,us
1,"Do NOT use this wallet!. Both my friend and I had severe issues with withdrawing our Bitcoin. When I complained about my account to Technical support, they said it was a technical error with my account that has never happened before. They told me they would ‚Äúfix it‚Äù and they did. 

Against my better judgement, I didn‚Äôt delete the app and continued to use it. Now I‚Äôm having trouble withdrawing my Bitcoin again. I‚Äôve complained to technical support once again but they haven‚Äôt done anything about it yet. 

I believe it‚Äôs just a way for them to prevent people from withdrawing their Bitcoin.

Very user-friendly interface, there are absolutely all the coins, you can collect and monitor your portfolio. Very powerful functionality for conducting cryptocurrency market analytics. It is also convenient to add coins to metamask. A useful and interesting news section. I love everything about this app. Hopefully soon they will make their own exchange and then there will be no need for competitors! I'm still waiting for the rating of IDO sites, this is sorely lacking in the application and on the site. Competitors have such functionality, but they are not convenient. I would like all this to be in your application. Please also integrate portfolios via API from various exchanges. This functionality is very useful for analyzing your portfolio. Really best app for tracking portfolio but really needs an option to swipe and remove coins as seems to go all sorts of weird if a coin gets delisted and no way to click edit and remove when this happens. Btw I‚Äôm using an updated iPhone if devs are wondering. Would update to 5 stars if it actually worked because it WAS useful  The developers are great!

It did the same thing to me. If you can fix all of this, it wld be perfect again.‚Äù",2021-12-10 20:42:52,Filer1,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
2,"Worst Update Ever!. While there are a few additions to this new update that were good (keeping track of price per coin and transaction fees), the app now glitches more than ever. Totals, coin prices, and charts will not refresh half the time. Also, the app freezes up when trying to enter additions and subtractions to my positions. I find myself having to force quit the app many times just to enter staking interest for a few coins. Sometimes the app just doesn‚Äôt work at all in the portfolio section, no matter how many times I try to refresh or relaunch the app. Also, in the portfolio section, we use to have the ability to pull up charts for individual coins, but now we have to go to another section to do that. Also, on the front page, I‚Äôve found that ‚ÄúGlobal Overview‚Äù seems to randomly pop up at times and I have no idea how to do it when I want to see it. It just randomly appears sometimes. Also, the profiles for individual coins really need to be updated. There are plenty of coins still listed as being on exchanges that they‚Äôve been delisted from, others not being listed as being on exchanges that I‚Äôve recently purchased them on, and many coins where there are no news entries for the past few years even though I can find plenty of articles if I do a Google search. This app needs more stability and a comprehensive update to the content of the coin profiles.",2021-01-16 01:03:18,Mr. Willcott,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
5,"Useful but one of the most frustrating apps. This app worked amazing and was very useful until 2 updates ago‚Ä¶.after the second to last update my watch lists stopped showing up correctly. Only some coins show up in my watch lists. It says 14 are in the list but only one show up and I can‚Äôt add them back again. Figured maybe it was a glitchy update so I just waited for the next one but I just updated it again and it‚Äôs still like that. Makes the app useless to keep my lists, so frustrating because it was a very useful app when it worked. Btw I‚Äôm using an updated iPhone if devs are wondering. Would update to 5 stars if it actually worked because it WAS useful

5,Must Have App. This is a must have app for any person interested in learning about or investing in crypto.  It allows you to track your own portfolio investments in a comprehensive way that no exchange does.  Mind you it may take some time for you to enter your current investments. however it will be more than worth the time when you are able to track your percentage allocations and also track your winners and losers. this information is not calculated on your basic wallet or your exchanges. in addition the news and announcements that are provided for your selected crypto allows you to DYOR. In short this app is an absolutely must have for anyone who wishes to dabble in crypto currencies or engage FOMO or YOLO investing.  lol,2021-06-13 12:33:39,Craig Barrett,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
4,"Changes, some good, some bad. Hi! Overall I enjoy this application. It allows me to track my purchases across platforms I may have bought from using the PORTFOLIO tab. Nevertheless, I see that some changes have been made to this page. 

I like privacy mode. That‚Äôs a nice option. Nevertheless, when I used to press on the percentage button at the top right corner, I would get a DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR increase or decrease view, telling me exactly how much money I lost or gained. I see that the total money lost or gained has moved out of that box to right below the total asset number. However, it has completely left the individual assets. Meaning, when I pressed on the total percentage at the top right, I would get ‚Äúdollar mode‚Äù where I can scrolll down and see how much I gained or lost per asset. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE. Please bring this back!! So disappointed I updated. Please please bring this back.",2021-01-12 16:23:43,Pizzahatyou,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
3,"Gets the job done.. This website is amazing because of all the great assets it has and etc. The app works great as well. One can easily look up a coin or token and check its current price and daily gain/loss percentage. On the other hand, this has 3 stars because there are many apps like this, that even allow people to do more. With this said, a few things should be considered.

1. Being able to set alerts for cryptos on your watchlist, so if say Adshares surpasses 50¬¢ it will send a notification. Or if a coin on a watchlist has dropped or gained a certain percentage.

2. Add a widget. So certain coins or tokens on a watchlist could be easily looked at from the iPhone home screen, like CoinBase‚Äôs widget.

3. Donation option through the app via crypto, PayPal, or IAP. Maybe even purchasing something that gets rid of the small banner ad at the bottom of the app.

4. Looking at social media/reddit posts about the crypto through an embedded WebKit. You already have something sort of like this on your website. Just allow users to go to a ‚Äúsocial media view‚Äù or something where they can see updates from the crypto company or about the crypto.

This app has fabulous potential, and this website is one of the best to look at crypto stats with. Keep up the good work! Hope this review helps! Thank you for reading this.",2018-06-12 06:08:35,ChrisCrutts,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
4,Great app 1 thing.

5,"Easily the cleanest/stable crypto app you will ever come across.. What an app. What a team behind the app. I use binance for trading and I hate their UI. It‚Äôs so raw and in your face. So I came across CoinMarketCap(recommended by my elder brother)
The moment I opened the app I fell in love because of the minimalistic style. There was a problem though, after a few seconds the app would say network timed out.
I reported the issue and was responded to by their development team promptly and they got the issue fixed. This app has helped me enjoy making tons of $$$ even more! Highly recommend: if you are into crypto, like making money, enjoy using a clean UI",2021-09-17 01:52:58,surreal730,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
1,"So frustrating.. A few versions ago, you were able to see your gains for different periods of time (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, etc). It would calculate how much profit or loss you had accumulated over that time. 

Now, you cannot see any of those calculations other than 24 hour profit or loss. When you switch views to the 7 day chart or 30 day chart, the profit or loss only shows you the 24 hour value. It‚Äôs absolutely maddening. Even the list of coins, there percent of appreciation/depreciation of stuck on the 24 hour value, so I can‚Äôt see how much Bitcoin or eth have appreciated over a week or a month, only 24 hours. 

I reached out to the company and they said this was by design. What?!? Really?! In my opinion they took away one of the most useful aspects of this app. I am now looking for a replacement app as I have waited through 3 or 4 updates for them to bring it back and they haven‚Äôt.",2021-09-05 11:31:19,Kks1030,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
3,"OK but lacks functionality. I downloaded this app hoping that it would provide similar features of their site, however it‚Äôs quite lacking even for a first edition. First off, there is no iPhone X display compatibility so the app size is the old style if used on it. Furthermore, you cannot drill down into each coin to see further stats on them. The app seems more for just quick viewing of prices, but there are better apps at the moment that accomplishes this and provides a significant more amount of information at the touch of a finger. Lastly, the drop down at the top that‚Äôs supposed to show 24hr volume, btc dominance, etc shows ‚Äú?‚Äù for each stat.

As the market of such apps is quite extensive these days, I‚Äôd recommend looking elsewhere (CoinCap is much better currently) until CoinMarketCap decides to put more effort into theirs.",2018-05-02 23:20:05,thesourc3,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us

Not gonna give you some NBA career story, I didn‚Äôt do much. But I can say without hesitation I love this app. It‚Äôs easy to use design, no ads in sight, dark mode, all 3 of the major markets, and for me personally the ability to seamlessly switch between phone and pc really takes the cake.

4,"Convenient, But Noisy.. The app allows convenient access for looking up coins and tokens, getting their websites, and contract addresses. Unfortunately it gives automatic alerts for every coin / token in a watchlist with no option to disable it. And if you have a few lists that can result in getting alerts all day long. The only solution is to disable alerts entirely, or not use watch lists for organizing items you want to monitor or share. In case of the former, it results in not being able to use actual price alerts set. I‚Äôll keep the app because of its convenience, but alerts will stay disabled and I‚Äôll have to enable the specific price movements in another app.",2021-05-04 00:00:29,Prasand J,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
3,"Great app until recently. I am going to echo what some others have said. The app is pretty good just like their actual web site is great. That was until recently with an update or so. Now things do not load or update unless I force close the app and relaunch.  Then it may work for awhile.

This is quite frustrating as two of the features I like best, portfolio tracker & watchlist, are hampered by this. 

The portfolio tracker is, in my opinion, one of the best features of Coin Market Cap. If you are like most of us in crypto you have coins at several exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Phemex, etc..  The portfolio tracker lets you put in your transactions and fees so you can track your overall gains/losses by coin and as a total.",2021-09-03 19:52:28,Gmonwy,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
1,Terrible changes. So the ‚Äúsimpler and more friendly UI layout‚Äù is a complete lie and a massive step in the wrong direction. This is another example of a company having too many employees with nothing to do so they are told to make completely useless and unnecessary changes to the app. Another thing I don‚Äôt like is the community feed. There needs to be an option to turn that off because I have no interest in see all the spam posted there. I didn‚Äôt update the app for a long time for a specific reason. I didn‚Äôt want to deal with all the terrible changes made to the app. But about a week ago the app just completely stopped working so I was sadly forced to update.

CMC is the ‚Äúsource of truth‚Äù for many exchanges and investors. This effects the valuation of Shib in a bad way as circulating supply is part of the algorithm.

Rather than using the same method to calculate the TMC for each coin it uses different methods for different coins in an effort to affect the market.  I would never use CMC again as the false information it‚Äôs providing will lead investors in the wrong direction.  There are several other apps out there that provide actual facts rather than false and misleading information.

When trying to log in or make a new account the security check to slide a puzzle piece into place always results in failure in the app, stating ‚Äútoo many attempts‚Äù. It gave this error the first time and every time. It‚Äôs been broken for days.

The same security check functions properly on their website login, but I can‚Äôt recommend an app that doesn‚Äôt let you login and blocks 70% of its features behind that same obstacle.",2022-04-23 23:19:46,Kazayuki,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us
1,"Coin Market Cap is the worst. I invested in Saitama crypto and CMC put an ad bashing the coin on their site which led to the coin falling 50% in value within a few years. Since when does CMC take part in creating FUD? They are supposed to be a neutral company. Also, Saitama has enough market cap to be listed on their top 100 and CMC refuses to list Saitama on there giving some weak excuse that they are ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù. Well, when it comes to placing an ad promoting false FUD, they were certainly on top of that. Luckily they removed the ad after the Saitama legal team tore them another one and threatened them with lawsuit.

1,Glitches Glitches and more Glitches. When first installing this app I was very impressed. They had every crypto under the sun and it was so easy to use. The convenience of creating a watch list of all your favorite crypto and being able to watch and track all of them in one spot just blew me away. Two weeks later 90% of all my cryptos disappeared from my watch list. I can‚Äôt even make a new list because that disappears as well. I can‚Äôt set alerts anymore and I can‚Äôt track any of my crypto so it went from a 5 star app to a 1 star unusable app.,2021-06-15 16:10:24,Dtronz,CoinMarketCap,Apple App Store,us

1,Alerts. Got this app simply to get alerts when certain crypto‚Äôs go below a certain price so I know when to sell. Half the time I don‚Äôt get an alert and the other half I get the alert like 10 minutes after it has already happened. I even have been on my phone in another app knowing that I should be getting an alert and I don‚Äôt. What good is an alert going to be if it happens well after?! If you are planning on using this to hopefully save you some money by getting alerts then don‚Äôt bother.

The other problem is that this company still uses the absolute slowest network. If your btc address starts with a 1 not only are you going to get slow transactions but slow everyone else down too. Why hasn‚Äôt this been upgraded yet. The new technology has been around for years now. With this alone I‚Äôm looking for a new place to go. But the kicker is the horrible customer service. I still haven‚Äôt got a solution or a reply offering to help.  
There is also times that if you want to sell say $50 or whatever the fees are insane. I went to trade 50 and the fee was $9 are you kidding me? 
You guys need to fix the issue with sending from the trading wallet to your btc wallet immediately. It‚Äôs not working at all.

Yet it‚Äôs been a week and so yet again i‚Äôve asked multiple people from their support team and i still have yet to hear a response or get the reason why i was ‚ÄúFlagged‚Äù. Any time I ask they say it‚Äôs from a team above them and that I have to wait for the support ticket. I‚Äôm just tired of waiting for my cryto to ever arrive.

1,"They lie. I checked with Blockchain (BC) to ensure my account was clear to accept a 5-digit wire transfer deposit. I was assured my account was clean and ready for wire transfer. As soon as  BC received the wire transfer they put a hold on account withdrawals. They require me to answer a question on a transaction that happened a year ago because they had (unspecified) information that the receiver of the transaction was a scammer. Now until I answer their questions about who what and why, they will keep my money from me. They will also not allow me to close my account. First, I did nothing wrong. I am accused of nothing. All they want to do is invade my privacy over a old transaction. Meanwhile i have lost control over a considerable amount of money that I had plans to use for legitimate business purposes. I hate that they lied to me. I hate that they extort my private information for purposes they do not disclose. I hate the prospect that I might have to let them approve every transaction I make based on asking for private information / or they will deny me access to my money.

You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be able to get right on the app and just buy some. I have my card linked to my account. I entered how much I wanted to buy, I got an error message. I tried it again thinking it was a glitch, still nothing. I got on my computer and tried that, same thing. I contacted support and tried to get some help. Someone by the name of Ming was zero help, in fact they said this all happened because of something I did. I was informed, after ten failed attempts their system blocks your card from use. I only tried a total of four.

Ming tried to send me links to wire money, the two links I got didn‚Äôt even help with my issue. I spent over an hour on this chat to get answers and none was given. Sadly I left chat more upset then when I actually got on, after chat I sent an email to Blockchain to get more answers.

They replied in a timely manner. The information looked good, it felt like more help then what I got from Ming on their chat help. After doing what the email said, it still won‚Äôt take my card. I‚Äôm stuck in limbo right now, and unless Blockchain can actually help me figure out what happened I won‚Äôt be using them anymore.

I didn‚Äôt appreciate Ming implying I did something wrong, there was nothing professional about the help I got from this person. When I get a reply from Blockchain and hopefully get this figured out, I may update this review.",2021-10-22 06:01:57,Than[Q],Blockchain.com Wallet,Apple App Store,us

1,"Stole my money and customer service won‚Äôt do anything about it. I downloaded this app in march of 2021 and put in approx. $70 into BTC. After a while I went to withdraw my funds and the real problem of this scam app began. For a while, my bank was supported and I theoretically could‚Äôve withdrawn, but the loading process always took too long and never went through. Then the app updated itself to require a new level of verification to buy/sell, which upon sending in my info I was told something was incorrect and it wasn‚Äôt verified for nearly 6 MONTHS. I had emailed CS about it roughly 1 month into no word back and I didn‚Äôt get a response until AFTER the problem was solved 5 months later. Even after my ID has been verified and such I still cannot withdraw my funds because my (once supported) bank is no longer supported!

If you have a more technical issue that is not covered in their ‚Äúfrequently asked questions ‚Äú then they don‚Äôt answer or look into your question further they just send you the same ‚Äúfrequently asked questions‚Äù.
The problem is their ‚Äúfrequently asked questions‚Äù don‚Äôt cover every issue and so then their customer support doesn‚Äôt seem to know what to do so they just quit answering your requests.

How is the even possible. The security has to either be very low or inside jobs are going on never the less non of your information is safe. You have to think If they can go in and submit a transaction with my login information then the have access to pull from my bank accounts on file as well all while it would look like I did the transaction. Absolutely no security to any of your personal information. Do not trust this site or app there are several loopholes in the security that can surely lead to you becoming a victim of a cyber scam.

Great interest rates at BlockFi and Celsius by the way.  Check out rates on USDC in BlockFi-presently 8%!  Anyway, I saw an offer for interest in Blockchain.  I put in some money.  Never got a penny of interest.  Tried to swap to another coin.  Kept ‚Äúexpiring‚Äù before the swap.  Also, it was charging me $5 to switch from one stable coin to another.  Tried sending to a different wallet.  It wouldn‚Äôt let me.  Finally decided to cash out.  I discovered they put a 14 day hold on your money before you can cash out.  I had 2 transactions so I got my first one.  Waiting more days to get the rest.  Impossible to find acceptable information online.  Definitely appreciate Coinbase much more now.

Another thing is that the transactions are never instant.  So after you buy coins, they are usually not there even after a minute.  Watch out because if your hand moves too fast, you will end up creating multiple repetitious transactions like me.  I was trading on Dec 3, but on Dec 10, a transaction showed up saying ""failed"", which was just an failed attempt I made seven days ago due to transactions being not instant.

I sold my assets for USD and can see that I have USD on my wallet but when I attempt to withdraw my USD to my account it says I'm not eligible... NOT ELIGIBLE TO WITHDRAW MY OWN MONEY. Contacting support has also been made as difficult as possible, You need your wallet ID which will require a computer you cannot do most features on your mobile phone and even when you do bust out a computer and get in it will tell you youre ineligible to withdraw your money, Also cant use my USD to buy bitcoin the money is just stuck in a USD wallet that I cant withdraw from.

Over $19,000 I deposited and they took and never activated my funds!  Who does this and gets away with it!  Unheard of and now I am the fool.

1. Why is the current app getting bigger and bigger? The original installation package of a currency exchange exchange is hundreds of megabytes. After installation, at least a few gigabytes of space are gone. Use the user's precious disk space as a trash can, as much as you want?

I was a bit sour because the developers took  soooooo long to finally create the mobile version of their desktop software. They‚Äôre response was they wanted to ensure that the mobile version would be just as sleek as their desktop version and they did not disappoint. When it finally came out, they did NOT disappoint! It is thee best most secure mobile wallet out there for mobile wallets second after the manual ledger flash drive version which is only really useful for people holding over 10k in assets which may be a good reason to invest in a ledger if you have that kind of investment. But Exodus comes second right after that. The best part of Exodus improvements is its exchange-like monetary management abilities like exchanging various currencies within its platform, something it did not have in its early days. Thus it enjoys having exchange-functions to its users WITHOUT actually being an exchange where the loss of data and hacking is much more likely to occur in the cryptosphere.
All the best!!!",2021-02-11 09:57:19,akhBori,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Awesome wallet. Highly recommended. Obviously being a software wallet, it‚Äôs not the most secure wallet out there for large holdings. Software wallets are notoriously unsafe due to risks created by malware and viruses and make your precious crypto highly vulnerable if the proper steps aren‚Äôt taken to protect your device. However, I get great utility using this wallet for short term transfers/transactions for services like Changelly and shapeshift or when I‚Äôm planning on trading a bit on a volatile day. The best thing this wallet has going for it is the convenience of it whether it‚Äôs on your computer or on mobile. My primary wallet for storage is a ledger and admittedly it‚Äôs very annoying to have to bring it with you if you‚Äôre planning on potentially using it as well as having to plug it into your computer whenever you want to send assets. The wallet also has an exchange feature with reasonable fees in comparison to something like coinbase but with a larger selection of assets, which is extremely useful for a quick exchange without having to move it anywhere. Where this wallet lack in security, it makes up for in convenience 10 fold. All in all, I‚Äôd highly recommend this wallet for traders, but for hodlers I‚Äôd suggest going with something more secure and just using it as a transfer mechanism",2019-11-11 07:18:39,mduchow,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Nice wallet and helpful staff. So after literally months of digging into every crypto wallet available, I‚Äôve chosen Exodus as my go to. I‚Äôll keep it short while highlighting key components that won me over.
 1. It‚Äôs both a wallet and portfolio tracker! No other platform has the ability to let hold your own private keys while simultaneously giving you real-time data, charts and feedback about your holdings. 
2. Built in exchange! Piggybacking off my previous comment, the charting/data feature goes perfectly with the exchange. I like this because it allows me to trade and make proper adjustments to my portfolio without withdrawing my money. This feature is important because it allows you to maintain proper security of your private keys. 
3. Helpful staff! When I had a question related to their desktop platform I sent an email to staff. To my amazement I had a reply within 20 minutes of my initial message. 
If anyone reading this is like me and very indecisive... go with this wallet. It‚Äôs secure, visually appealing, and has the benefits of a wallet, exchange, and tracker built in one.",2019-06-10 05:00:49,ndkxicirnrnc,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
1,"Buggy, lack of support. I‚Äôve been using exodus for about one year and I‚Äôve noticed that my wallet  balance is often incorrectly high  when I first open the app, and then it will adjust down to the correct account balance after a few seconds. That‚Äôs annoying enough but yesterday when I checked my balance it went from the correct balance down to a very low and very incorrect balance. As I looked closer I saw that my ETH had just disappeared into thin air. I quit the app, re opened it, refreshed the wallet, and it was still the same. I contacted support and got one email  asking me to confirm that my transaction history seemed legit. I did not have time to crunch all the numbers but it seemed ok so I told them yes. I sent another email asking to confirm that they received my info and that they were working on the problem. I have gotten no further response from them despite repeated requests for an update on my case. They are not helping me. My ETH is gone. I‚Äôm 99% certain that my personal account was not hacked or compromised by myself because if it were they would have taken all of it instead of only taking 95% of my ETH. It appears that a couple of BTC-ETH exchanges that I made are not showing up in my wallet as ETH that I received. I‚Äôm not happy. I will be removing all of the rest of my coins from Exodus and looking for a better place to keep them.",2021-09-14 19:33:45,plinkerplop,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
3,"Intuitive UI/UX; Exorbitant minimums to transact. This team has done great things to provide people with a privacy-oriented window to the crypto world and defi. I love the fact that I can choose to buy with a bank card (of course forgoing anonymity) or choose to send in from another exchange. Access to ERC-20 tokens was awesome though i imagine it could be daunting for a newcomer to see a list of projects to choose from (best practice is to do your own research!!!). There are brief descriptions of projects in the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù sections. Of course they have access to most if not all major large cap coins.

Some things to keep in mind for newcomers: if you don‚Äôt know what gas fees are, you could very well pay more for a swap than you would want to if fees, potentially killing any profits you make. I used the platform to get access to certain coins and either sent them to cold storage or had them sitting for when the gains come. Another thing is that there are minimums required to exchange coins and ive seen this ‚Äúminimum‚Äù steadily increase with the market. Seemingly the minimum is always juuuuust above what I have - I think it‚Äôs time to put my tinfoil hat on and remember what the word ‚ÄúExodus‚Äù means",2021-02-22 17:28:25,BOTO PRO,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"Not your keys, NOT YOUR COINS.... If you don‚Äôt hold your own private keys to your crypto currency, you don‚Äôt OWN anything and you‚Äôre at risk. Get Exodus, the interface is straight forward and easily understood. It also happens to be beautiful!

 Hung up trying move crypto using private addresses help is a click away. Don‚Äôt understand the fee schedules, need help setting custom fees for smart contracts... Exodus has easy four min reads along with short videos to get you up and running. 

I run Exodus in conjunction with a Trezor hardware wallet and I‚Äôm loving the sense of financial freedom. No more middlemen between me and control of my digital assets. No more asking permission. I can get paid in Bitcoin for my services and have it available on Exodus for exchange or put it in cold storage on my Trezor within the hour. Take control, stop asking for permission to transact and stop paying ludicrous fees on Coinbase. Learn to use crypto exchanges and take back your digital freedom.

5,"Not scam after all. I have used this app for several months. Until this point I would have been an advocate for it. I deposited btc into my wallet and attempted an exchange for XMR immediately after the transaction was finished. I got an error message for the exchange and my btc had been sent to an address that I had not entered. I contacted support and was told I could contact my local police. This is an error on Exodus‚Äôs part. Be prepared to lose your money and then have support tell you your wallet was compromised. I was not logged out, there was a technical issue on their part and to skirt responsibility for their own mistakes they‚Äôre casting the blame on others. 

 Shortly after making this review my money was reimbursed. If the apps developers reimbursed me out of pocket, im truly impressed. The fact is I followed the btc to a known scammer. I was also given my XMR. Truly outstanding service if I was reimbursed out of pocket.",2021-08-15 02:02:14,csimhmons,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
5,"3+ Year User on Computer; Mobile is a Nice Touch. I have gone back and forth on what constitutes the easiest / safest option to store my crypto‚Äôs. I‚Äôve used several wallets (both mobile and on a PC), Exodus and settled upon the Ledger Nano S and Exodus for one Token. Because I‚Äôm a ‚ÄúHodler‚Äù and not a day to day trader I ended up removing everything from my Ledger and going back to Exodus a couple weeks ago. I did this because I got sick of the constant updates for the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Live and the need for the 12 phrase set with each update (via Ledger Live ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Just a bit too cumbersome for a guy that checks on things one or twice a year. I discovered the Mobile Exodus at this time, quite nice to see things more frequently. Haven‚Äôt tried to trade, transfer or exchange anything via the Mobile app yet, but for what I need, this works great.

5,"No Competion. Hands-down by far the most absolutely best of all crypto wallets by a long stretch. Prompt and reactionary support staff. Anonymous exchange regardless of Geo location. Seamless integration with Trezor cold storage. Master 12 word seed phrase and backup is as easy as it gets. Security of desktop and mobile apps actually feel secure. Higher fees than market average but to bypass uploading an ID and giving up bank information and all of the unnecessary central bank implications and requirements leaves Exodus ahead of the rest sticking to the true foundation and philosophy of the block chain, as intended, is priceless. Custodial options if you choose to do so . .  I have one issue and that is the 12 word seed phrase is exposed on the display when being typed with no option to hide it during a restore.

4,"Good apps but needs to fix update notifications.. Really like the iOS and windows apps, but the windows app has a permanent notification that‚Äôs says an update is available, and it doesn‚Äôt give an option to update. The link just takes you to a blog post they posted on their website with instructions that don‚Äôt coincide with the current state of the app. They should just have a button that directs you directly to the update (or remove the notification if their isn‚Äôt actually an update). I just downloaded the iOS app and the first thing that came up was a notification to update the app. If I just downloaded it from the App Store then why would it need updated? The iOS store doesn‚Äôt have an available update, so it makes me think something is wrong with the app, or management just doesn‚Äôt care about keep things up to date and accurately informative.

A few coins never arrived to the wallet and yet the blockchain scanners showed the transaction was done correctly and completed. I contacted support and the team were extremely helpful in understanding the situation (they also have a send a report feature which allows them to deal with your case with more information which is great). The real people are focused on your case and are able to deal much better with issue than automated team which is a great plus. My issue was fixed rapidly and the customer support agent I worked with was well spoken, prompt, and very helpful with solving my issue successfully.

I love how beautiful they have designed it. Secondly, so far with the minimal actions I‚Äôm taking, using the app is a joy. It‚Äôs super easy and intuitive. I might add a future review later as I begin doing more than just loading crypto onto the platform. But for what I‚Äôve experienced up to now, I am loving this new wallet.

I only wish my state was not one of the states that prohibits active exchanges through this app. If I can use that process this would be a perfect app. I would give the app four stars because of this, but it is not the developers‚Äô fault that my state does not allow such functionality, that‚Äôs five stars.",2021-12-02 05:23:06,Perkygrubb,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
3,"Very good, some minor issues. Huge offering of different cryptos, ability to buy BTC, and the ability to exchange between cryptos directly within the app is all great. The main complaint I have is that the graphs aren‚Äôt always accurate. Sometimes my balance is shown dipping to 0, sometimes I supposedly gained 30% of my portfolio value in an hour, with no transactions or price changes that would have caused such a change. Also when viewing my balance for a certain coin, the initial number is correct but when I drag my finger along the graph, the value changes in $, but displays as if the number of coins I have is what is changing. Another issue is there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to view my available balance after purchasing BTC. I would expect to be able to send all of what I‚Äôve purchased, or see what the wait is caused by.

Nowhere did it say there was a .025 ETH fee before I made this transaction, otherwise I would‚Äôve never done it. This app stole (now) $80 from me on a very insignificant transaction and all I get is automated e-mails when I demand an explanation as to why I wasn‚Äôt prompted about this ETH fee beforehand. So hire more support and be a lot more clear about your fees cuz I am incredibly angry about your garbage app

To developer who responded: if it was my error why did support refund the ETH to me?

1,"Lots of fees. Exodus does offer a neat looking app with a large quantity of crypto that can be traded however, unlike other exchanges Exodus charges a rather large import fee... luckily for me it was only a small transfer as a test but nevertheless burned $10 (in this case 20% of the transfer lol) all that without even making a single trade. It‚Äôs also worth noting that each trade itself could be about ~$10 in fees even when exchanging crypto-crypto. I would advise caution and doing your homework prior to using this app because the high import fees, high exchange fees, and trade minimums which all vary depending on type of crypto and could easily lead one to burn a significant portion of an account just trying to exchange one crypto for another. I promptly transferred my remainder out to another wallet which strangely had the only reasonable fee in line with industry standard applied to that transaction (~2¬¢). In my opinion this is a shady operation while I won‚Äôt say there isn‚Äôt some fine print describing all these fees it certainly isn‚Äôt what I would call ‚Äútransparent‚Äù.",2021-02-15 11:55:37,mistabig,Exodus,Apple App Store,us
2,"Clean, pretty, expensive. Looks are cool.  They do however make the assumption that you want a dark background.  There should at least allow an option for light backgrounds too. (You can choose textures, colors, and other features, but all the options are dark. 
Unlike most other sites, there is a few (paid in Ethereum) for most exchanges between Cryptocurrencies.  This makes it more expensive if you do a lot of trading (my original reason for opening this account.)  I‚Äôll leave the few crypto I have here, but this has just become my ‚Äúhold‚Äù account, not my trading account. 
Exodus‚Äôs options‚Äîthe Apps‚Äîmay one day provide more useful features.   I‚Äôd like one that allows you to immediately see what you put in, what you have earned, and where it now stands.  (They have tools for seeing the % of your assets in any coin, but not your profit and loss).

I was shocked to have my call answered not by a voicemail, not by an employee but by the owners themselves. They handled my issue extremely quickly and professionally. After my first call that day I had to call back 2-3 times to get the issue handled that day. The phone never rang more than once and they knew immediately that it was me. I guess what I‚Äôm saying is they have the best customer support of any company I‚Äôve ever dealt with, they take great care of making sure this is not only the best performing but also the most beautiful and easy to use Crypto Currency Wallet that I‚Äôve used.

 Also, I had an issue. I had purchased ONT. The transaction went fine, BUT...! I later found out you have to have ONG in order to do anything with your ONT! There‚Äôs no exchanging or cashing out, without it. 
 So, I promptly contacted Exodus support. It took a few days for them to get back to me, but, they issued me the necessary amount of ONG to make transactions. That was fine, but, I still had to go off the Exodus wallet and find a place to get a ONG address, seeing how Exodus doesn‚Äôt support ONG (apparently working on a patch) 
Long story, longer...I finally got an address so I was able to import ONG into my Exodus wallet, and make the exchange that I was waiting to make. Thankfully!!! I didn‚Äôt lose any money while waiting. 
Otherwise, the app has worked pretty well, and, the Exodus team at least responded to, as well as provided me with the necessary crypto to make my transaction.

5,"Best crypto wallet ever. #1 I think you guys should really really add a feature that shows you at what price you got into another crypto. So if I exchange BTC for ETH and I do it when ETH is $1,000 then it should always show that I got into it when it was $1,000 that way if it goes up and I want to sell then I know okay I bought in or exchanged at $1k so I want to take out x amount only. It should also let me go directly from BTC and ALL other cryptos without asking me the amount I want to convert so if I want to buy a laptop or something and it cost $2,000 and I want to use Cardano to pay then I can just click on BTC and say I want to pay in ADA and boom it does all the conversations on its own and all I say to the app is that they want $2,000 USD",2021-09-14 21:38:32,DevilsTestament,Exodus,Apple App Store,us

After conducting a few test transactions in and out, testing the restore functionality on a separate iOS device, as well as reading a number of reviews online about the wallet, I feel confident to begin using it regularly for day-to-day activities.

However, I have to refrain from giving 5 stars because of a cosmetic design flaw‚Ä¶ no landscape support for iPad! Why, when people have been using iPads in landscape mode for years now (with the Apple keyboard cover or similar) do so many app-makers force vertical-only orientation on their iPad apps?

So, currently in the charts within exodus you can only hold 1 finger and move it along the chart to see the price based on where your 1 finger is touching the chart, but a 2 finger touch on the charts used for determining price changes within a specified range defined by the distance between the two fingers touching the chart would be very useful. This functionality is available in the default/native iOS stock app, and the Robinhood app, and quite a few others.

I‚Äôm sure many others as well as myself would love the option to choose a different chart pattern to read besides the line chart, such as the candlestick pattern chart. An advanced chart with volume displayed would be great.

Market cap, 24-hour volume data, etc. would be a nice feature to add too if possible.

Live real-time asset price updates as well as real-time currency balance updates as the price changes would be amazing. 

Bug fixes: my app kept telling me all day today that I needed to be connected to the internet, so I was unable to view my portfolio data while I was at work. This is my first time experiencing this and I believe it was due to my phone connecting to random public wifi‚Äôs while I was at work.

I needed that money. They have ignored the last two times I contacted them. My messages have been respectful and professional.

Rewards are paid out on every staking deposit 25 days after EACH deposit. Also found that they have low transaction fees both for sending/receiving and also if you decide to stake.  News and updates on whichever currency your interesting in also. The wallet could have brighter features on the home page. I‚Äôve noticed that the better or brighter a platform looks makes for better adoption of itself overtime. Kinda like a well dressed person or fancy car.

2,"DO NOT USE THIS WALLET!!!!!. When I first started using this wallet, I loved it. The UI is amazing, the app is super easy to use, and they support an incredible amount of different currencies(as well as, offer high APY on many of them)

I was holding a fairly low amount on the platform, at first, then slowly started to send more of a certain coin(high APY) Well, I decided that I would send some of my coins that I was considering selling for conversion. 

The transfer went really well. Incredibly smooth, appeared in a matter of seconds. The issues happened when I tried to convert said coins. I noticed a box that said there were transfer fees, which I was expecting, and I needed ETH in my wallet. So I sent ETH to my Exodus wallet. When I tried the transfer again, that same box told me I didn‚Äôt have enough to cover the conversion(I had sent over about $20 in ETH) 

The transfer and conversion fees are outrageous. After this debacle with the conversion, I tried to find another currency to convert my coin to, that wasn‚Äôt so high in fees. Every other coin I tried, had a higher minimum trade amount. Meaning my coin is being held hostage on the platform. 

I URGE EVERYONE, PLEASE, DO NOT USE THIS WALLET/PLATFORM. THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO GET THE MOST FROM THEIR PORTFOLIO.",2021-11-28 10:01:59,xxITzzMASONx,Exodus,Apple App Store,us

I see a lot of potential with this app compared to others I‚Äôve tried, and I‚Äôve tried way too many. However, their customer support isn‚Äôt great, their supported coins for Trezor is lacking, and the Apple Pay feature is a disaster. I‚Äôve tried multiple times to get attention from customer support for issues with the Apple Pay feature and had very little success even getting a reply. If they increase the number of supported coins and get Apple Pay to work, then I‚Äôll stay with them and quit testing out other wallets.

I didn‚Äôt think about that, so hopefully this saves you money and if you still download it well then you must not care about your money...Sorry Exodus your customer service is and was always surprisingly great but your fees are according to a small application called ‚ÄúBlockchain‚Äù I‚Äôm paying 68% more then I should.

Edit V.1- Thanks to the developers to take their time to reply a review. I have seen some changes these few days on the ‚ÄúNow‚Äù & ‚ÄúThen‚Äù prices on the crypto which is a very informative feature. I hope the developers could maybe add a feature in which it shows the price when you purchase the coins.

4,Great all in one app. The app seems to be very well put together. Loads quickly and can restore a wallet from other multi wallet apps. One suggestion is to integrate custom nodes on any coin as sometimes the app nodes are slow to sync. It would be nice to add custom node login for non-public nodes for more privacy to those who wish for it not just ip. Custom fees need to be added to all coins. The fee structure is not right especially for erc based tokens including ETH itself. Additionally the option to restore a supported coin by restoring from seed would be nice then users could load all of their personal wallets to the app for a true one stop shop but for now users must send coins from other wallets to Exodus.,2021-02-05 03:46:10,111111111111111112122111,Exodus,Apple App Store,us

I reached out to the 24/7 help desk with a response 5 hours later. There was no explanation why my funds disappeared just basic instructions to update app and update network. I did this multiple times and the bitcoin still didn‚Äôt show up. Then out of nowhere the bitcoin showed up in my wallet only to be pending still. This has been on going for three days.

In the meantime the currency is fluctuating in price, and you‚Äôre not able to buy in at your desired price point. Just a fair warning! Update: when the currency became available again, almost 5 days later. I didn‚Äôt have enough funds because the coin price skyrocketed, and BTC plummeted.

1,"This wallet is a joke - avoid!!. I‚Äôm an experienced crypto holder who usually uses a hardware wallet to store my crypto, and I‚Äôve used other mobile wallets for small crypto holdings. Didn‚Äôt use Exodus due to mixed feedback from other users, but decided to give it a try at a conference where Exodus was giving away bitcoin as a promotion to download the wallet. 

The promotional bitcoin did appear - for one day - and then disappeared the next day, never to return. The same thing happened to my friend. I‚Äôve been emailing support for weeks now, nothing works, seed phrase restore, nothing. The bitcoin is gone. I‚Äôve wasted more time on this issue than the promotion is worth!!

I would love to send either out of my wallet to be able to reinvest in other assets. Unfortunately it will cost me a couple hundred just to meet the minimum sending limit to be able to withdraw from my wallet which with the fees associated will cost me more money.

Seriously the best for HODLers. Plus the majority of newcomers unfamiliar with DeFi, liquidity pools/farming, etc. that would benefit from something they‚Äôre more accustomed to. It‚Äôs the best ‚Äúbridge‚Äù for getting into crypto wallets from traditional checking/savings accounts. 
The APY being ridiculously higher than regular bank rates is what sticks out and is what makes this a great wallet to HODL coins like ADA or VET; their returns are too good to pass up. It‚Äôs a great alternative to a bank savings account",2021-09-17 09:00:30,CosmicFalls,Exodus,Apple App Store,us

I‚Äôve waited up to 24 hours for a Bitcoin withdrawal on other apps and exchanges and with Exodus I‚Äôve never waited longer than 5 minutes to receive a payment into the app or to receive a payment in another wallet sending from the app. Add on the ability to use Apple Pay to buy Bitcoin straight from the app and the the lowest fees out there- This app is always my #1 go to with anything Bitcoin.

Their team is very involved, and lightning fast when you contact them for support. Over 100 coins you can store all in one place relieving the headache of having multiple wallets. I only suggest a few things. First, you don‚Äôt have access to your private keys on the iOS version, and second you cannot pick the fees in which you send transactions. It calculates them for you. And although they calculate the ‚Äúbest‚Äù fee to send it‚Äôs just better to have complete control.

2,"Buying coins and converting. When I buy coins, why do I have to buy bitcoin? When I do that, I immediately lose money there. Fees supposedly covered so where did my money go?
Then when I convert to another coin like Cosmos, I lose money on that transaction as well? Again, fees supposedly covered but I don‚Äôt get $100 worth.

The $500 I spent became $480 in a matter of seconds. 

I understand fees but there was no explanation of fees, it even said fees were covered by Exodus so where did that $20 go?

I use Coinbase primarily but saw a comment on there saying the APR earned in Cosmos was double on this app and that‚Äôs why I downloaded it. 

Why can‚Äôt I buy Cosmos directly? 
Why can‚Äôt I buy directly in app? Instead it routes me to an internet browser to make my purchases?

Makes me wonder how difficult cashing out is.

I have it two stars because I‚Äôm hoping the APR really is more with this platform than it is with Coinbase. 

If I could figure out where that $20 went, or get that money back, 5 stars easy. 
It did not go from a dip in the market, that I‚Äôd understand.

However, after exchanging a few cryptos I discovered that I was being charged hundreds of dollars per transaction. It worked out to be over 16%. On every exchange. I caught it after the second one, but it was an expensive mistake. 
The next problem I had was when I chose to withdraw from the exchange, and instructed them to transfer ALL of each asset, they left about $40 of each asset behind. (An amount that is now apparently too small for them to transfer). So, that money is stuck there. My emails to support have been returned with generic and unhelpful responses.

Only thing Id prefer to see is a cheaper exchange instead of going to Coinbase/ Uphold/ Kraken to do them. Also, when doing an exchange it would be better to have the cost of such transaction to be shown. It seems like a hidden fee and also is pretty steep. I go from my portfolio of assets, but when I go to exchange it shows less of my actual holdings.

Well I‚Äôve been doing a deep dive on many different types of wallets I‚Äôve tried I think a couple dozen and this one by far has been the most beautiful and well laid out in terms of the UI. When it comes to functionality I found it to be intuitive simple and highly functional. Plus with all the built-in decentralized exchanges and apps that are available and soon more apps will become available in the United States I see exit is becoming the most popular wallet.

3,"Eh...Meets Expectations. So far (started receiving repetitive survey requests about 12 hours after signing up), the App has been meeting expectations (which weren‚Äôt high, as I‚Äôm still learning). 

The App performs as promised and I especially appreciated all of the beginner/fundamental information that was provided for crypto newbies like myself - definitions, presentations, news articles, etc. 

However, I didn‚Äôt find the App‚Äôs layout very user friendly. The tools and views you‚Äôd think one would utilize on a daily basis are not easily found or conveniently located to one another. It‚Äôd also be nice if all of the icons had meaningful labels to provide a hint as to what their related menu options may be. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a financial incentive behind the layout, such as making you look harder for things to eat up your time so your money sits in the accounts longer to earn interest, but If I had a choice, I‚Äôd rather pay a higher fee for a service that a provider honestly disclosed if I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the added aggravation of ads, marketing and ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the view to see how much money I lost/gained [Waldo]‚Äù fiasco.",2019-12-31 04:42:04,Bryan Squared,Exodus,Apple App Store,us

So far I‚Äôm day 3 with trying to puzzle this app out and pushing ahead until I do. But seriously not happy if this is what everyone considers ( user friendly) because it more certainly is not user friendly No dictionary to define new terms important to users No support to quickly answer questions And no information on the different crypto currency so a person can learn what currency is and which might be purchased. Would rate this App for moderate to advanced for those who ( invest in crypto) not for new users

6months later 
Ok after using the wallet for 6 months I still stand by my original statement.

Functionally speaking, this wallet is the best I‚Äôve seen. The reason I haven‚Äôt given 5 stars is because you‚Äôll need to use a portfolio manager to get more accurate/relevant information about Crypto and your gains/losses. 

Download this wallet and connect it to a portfolio manager if you plan to hodl or exchange coins that aren‚Äôt on bull run.

Great team. Binance, and other competitors are also incredible, but nothing beats the simplicity of Exodus for tracking and holding your assets.

Thank you Exodus for the gains & the operability.

Side note: I would add to your marketing. Exodus actually allows you to buy with certain debit cards on apple pay, and the BTC shows up in less than 30 minutes.

I'm not sure if it's an active sync or if I have to manually move stuff around if I add later on to one or the other. My only real gripe is with the state of Texas not allowing me to purchase via the app. It's frustrating to be forced through an exchange or work through something off shore via vpn.

You have to have a minimum amount of Bitcoin deposited before you can withdraw. So I had to deposit more Bitcoin paying high gas fees just to withdraw what I had in. The deposit time takes 30 min+ I think mine took about an hour.  Any other exchanges are near instant.

Then after submitting my withdrawal it was flagged for further review which took them almost a day to notify me. I had to fill out a form giving them a picture of my Drivers license and then for them to tell me it could take another 3 business days to approve. Again any other exchange is near instant.
