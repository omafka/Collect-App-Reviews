Crypto.com,$cashguy$,2021-08-25 19:03:14,"Great app. So far I am very new to this app, however from what I’ve experienced, most of the negative reviews are from beginners that did not take the time to read and understand what they were getting themselves into. I currently have the jade green card and I can say that I have already received my Netflix rebate so that works. I have not tried to withdraw my funds yet as I’m waiting on my money to transfer so I can test everything, however I have spend money with the virtual card and got my money back in cro that way as well. So far it has done everything it should. Also, I have experienced one problem with my card info not displaying on one of my devices however the customer support has been great and they are working on it. If you find yourself with that problem, I would recommend trying a different device if possible. In the end customer support has been kind and respectful and if you take the time to understand the fees that this app should help you earn some serious cash. In the end, just do test payments and be 100% sure of what should happen and be patient. I just hope that they get a website working and one point, other than that I am happy with what I have :)",NEGATIVE,us,Apple App Store

Crypto.com,4120angel4120,2021-12-18 16:35:32,"Doesn’t allow you to buy crypto after a while using the app.. I’ve been using the app for about 6 months now and was actually enjoying it. But for the past week I have been trying to buy different crypto and everytime I try, it never goes through. There is always a blank white page after trying to buy anything. Sometimes in will say there is an error that occurred. So I contacted the app through the chat and they could not help me at all. The help chat is completely useless in this issue. I asked if there was a number to call but the chat doesn’t help you with that either. Then I figured maybe it’s my bank that is not letting the transaction happen but I called my bank and they said they haven’t stopped anything or seen any attempts to buy crypto from the app. Today I tried to delete my card information from the app and then re enter my card information to buy some crypto to see if that would make it work. To my surprise the error occurred did not pop up this time but instead the app says that my card issuer declined the transaction and to call my bank to fix the issue. Well I did call them again to see if now they where declining it and they told me again there was no attempt to buy any crypto from the app. My bank didn’t decline anything. So the app is just falsely accusing that my bank declined it. This app has to many bugs and when you need help for anything there isn’t anyone to actually talk to.

Crypto.com,crypto jj,2022-02-18 13:39:08,"Investors beware. This app started great, it has many good features like the airtime pay for cellphone service that you can use with the Crypto that your holding. The downfall happened to me recently after securing the account with 2fa. In the beginning of the account security it was great, transfer went smooth, but then there was a attack on CRYPTO last month that caused some disturbances resulting in a 2fa reset forcing certain users to apply this change. Since this was done for me already it didn’t bother me until I went to transfer funds to discover the 2fa was not accurate. This is where the problem started. I contacted customer service and the bot spat out a inaccurate solution resulting in me texting a random agent that request that I submit a video for “security” reasons. After providing said video, it was not good enough, so I have to change email address to “secure” the account. I thought it was over until I get another email saying “he he hee” we need another video of glycine hiding a ransom sign. Now the crypto card I have is frozen and this is still a ongoing issue.

Update: In order to Get back into the account I had to literally submit 8 MORE VIDEOS!!! Keep in mind that it’s in a UNSECURE EMAIL, which means your identity will be compromised by another party to be used without your knowledge. This is a Major concern of mine and with the current trend I’m not sure if I will be victimized by this FORCED “security” policy.

I contacted them, took screen shots,  let them know what was going on and that I was losing my profits by the second….  They responded saying it would be fixed later.  Not “let us trade it where you need it or anything of the sort”. They waited until it dropped all the way down to what I bought it at!  Then had the audacity to say, and I quote ”. Thanks for the reply. I totally understand, however, the issue was resolved and you were able to withdraw the funds.
If you have additional questions do not hesitate to get back to us.”   They basically said screw you the same way Robin Hood app does. Scams.   COINBASE and COINBASE PRO is the way to go.  DO NOT GET SCAMMED WHEN YOU SHOULD BE MAKING MONEY!  Again, do not use this app.  Buy rates are always off compared to the actual market and always in their favor.

When I try to make a purchase some of the times it will go through most of the times it doesn’t go through and the issue is not my bank it is the application. I tried to go through their customer service, but their best advice was to transfer money to the application. What if I don’t want to transfer money, I want to use my debit card so I can purchased the crypto as I go along. Also,If you have a customer that is telling you there’s an issue with a certain part of the application why not try to resolve the issue instead of telling them to not use that part of the application and do their purchases a different way. Overall, yes I do like the application, but I get frustrated very often with it because of the fact that I cannot make my purchases that easily.

Crypto.com,Vischietta,2021-12-28 23:57:30,"Fantastic Platform!. Do all of your DD before diving into digital currency. This platform is fantastic for both beginners and veterans alike. There are many benefits baked in and from my experience, Once I’ve initiated an ACH transfer from my personal account, I’ve had access to the funds within 24 hours, in my Crypto account. That is a huge deal. I’ve used Other platforms where transfers have taken 3 days to complete, and up to nearly 3 weeks. Hoo-rah to this team for creating a quick process, among all the other benefits of their platform!!! One suggestion - I don’t believe any of these platforms have utilized yet - Y’all should integrate a way for users to buy crypto with their “Apple” balance or Apple gift cards. If I were to receive a gift card, other than shopping, I can’t convert the balance into fiat, but it’d be wonderful to sink that balance or gift card into CRO, ETH, SHIB, etc… When a user initiates a buy order, the app gives about 12 seconds to confirm, I believe that’s because of price fluctuation. I wonder if the same concept could be used to buy increments of altcoins - i.e. $20 for 20 worth of CRO… ? Either way, great job, keep it going, and hoo-rah!

They just now opened up US to use a separate program to exchange tokens ( coins), so should be less expensive fees in trading and remember you will pay transfer fees to other crypto wallets ( called gas fees), but the coins moved dictate the amount, due your research before trading to check tax consequences for each and every transaction, can be a nightmare!

Taking money out is pretty straight forward as long as your bank is on the list of compatible banks (which are big name banks and credit unions) I have a very small credit union so I had to open a bank account that was on that list. Pretty common with most app involving bank linking. The only thing I would like to be improved is faster customer service.

Out of all the Crypto exchanges out there, this is the one that clearly stands out due to their professionalism and consistent high-quality experiences to include this app. Over the last few years I have done business with several Centralized Exchanges and this one happens to be my favorite due to their privacy practices, stable experiences and tight customer service. If ever I had a question related to my investments they were quick to answer. Not only that, they have taken proactive steps to ensuring secure practices. With all of that said I would also highly-recommend that anyone reading this review to also consider a “cold storage” solution if they want even more control and security over their investments. Also, seriously do your homework in this space as there is a lot to learn and—at times—peril. Inform yourself, take calculated risks (or don’t) and mitigate any unnecessary risk or lack of security that you can. This space is both promising and relatively new and will not go away by virtue of the follies of some of the less mature characters out there.

Turning a few hundred bucks into tens of thousands, even while I'm sleeping is the most fun I've erer had buying stuff!

CDC has been very very shady the past few months. They change huge polices over night, multiple times a month, and without notice. At least recently. You can’t trust them. Don’t fall into the trap too of getting one of their cards because they can slash those rates overnight (as they did) and then “upgrade it” slightly to make it seem like they’re doing you a favor lol look up some of their Reddit forums and you’ll see how much of the community, especially a lot of their older loyal investors, have been screwed over lately. You can’t trust these guys because they don’t communicate ANY changes they’re going to make. Or if they do by chance, they’ll enact it days before the announced date just to throw everyone for a loop and screw them up that way. The only people who will try to convince you that CDC is still good are the people who invested more than they can afford to lose in CRO (their crypto). They’re afraid if CDC goes down, CRO will go down and they’ll lose money. My advice is to use coinbase instead. Never had any problems with them.

I think it is shady that there’s a magic “premium” added to coins when BTC is rising, and this is a money grab in my opinion because that premium is not applied when you sell. For example, CRO was .1210 when I tried to buy, and after doing the math (which is not provided because they know it’s shady) my average cost was somewhere around .125. Not a huge difference but that is hard earned profit by this point. I have been trying to get my CRO card for weeks now and I have been told that the only way I can continue with my application is to provide a picture of my SSN card. This was due to me moving addresses multiple times in the past few years because I am a college student. It is very frustrating and the support, albeit responds in a timely manner, does not seem like they really want to get you to your end goal.

They will show and record incorrect or higher than market prices, and those prices are shown when buying, but if you already own a coin, and go to sell at that same time, the selling price is magically way lower than any other price they’re showing.

The issue is that the app is almost unusable. If anyone says this app is easy, they were lucky or lying. Banks consider it a scam, so just getting past that is a pain, but even if you do the app has an extreme chance of just glitching. Then if you do manage to begin trading there can be serious delays of over a week making it difficult to make time sensitive decisions. Lastly is what i consider to be mild scamming regarding transfers. Transferring into the app was very easy... Transferring out after being disappointed was obviously set up to be difficult. Setting up transfers is extremely glitchy and made me have to write down addresses manually because the app would glitch every time i went to copy one. Also with minimum limits far higher than the ones set for transferring in, i literally couldn't take out what i put in. Lastly the app is just simply slower and clunkier than any other crypto app ive found.

Crypto.com,theOtherWB,2021-09-03 02:49:48,Okay I’m doing a new review.. I’m only giving four stars because you really need to do your homework to learn about prices. The coins themselves have different sale % that come off the top. Crypto itself has no fees for buying/a unless you’re using your debit/ccard. However you need to learn the sale percentages of the coins. The price reflected on the graph daily is not the actual price. That’s the buy price. What I do is use the Binance app for the real price so that I’m not ticked off when I sell and find it’s $20 to sell when actually they’re reasonable.

Crypto.com,Señor T.,2022-02-12 01:24:23,"Horrible Experience!!! Do Not Trust - READ FIRST. I would NEVER recommend this app to anyone looking to invest their hard-earned money into crypto! After NUMEROUS “messaging conversations,” I’ve been left feeling completely helpless after receiving computer generated responses and not once being offered addl help in resolving the issue - or the $25 I was promised for signing up. 
After trying multiple different types of payment methods from debit to credit cards and being unsuccessful at every turn, I don’t have so much as a customer service number to call and speak to anyone about this. I’ve spoken to my banks multiple times and after asking several times for a customer service number during these message conversations, I have yet to receive a number or response regarding my question. It’s been a 3-day process and I have yet to be able to invest a single dollar because of this flawed system. 
If you’re looking to invest in the “near-future” and don’t mind being left helplessly in the dark, this may be the place for you, if not, and you’re looking to hop the train sooner than later, I'd look elsewhere.",NEGATIVE,us,Apple App Store

I engaged them to please help in recovering of my Cryptocurrency tokens/funds of about $45,560 from a Forex company that scammed me, CryptoFx to be precised. Their recovery specialist by the name of Hackermanisoc assisted me step by step and we worked together and without doubt I was actually amazed with how he assisted me to recover my funds from the Scammers .

I was also drawn to the high staking rewards. I was especially excited to see that you can buy with a CC or Debit card. 

Unfortunately many features on the app just did not work for me.. was unable to purchase with a Credit Card (tried several times with two cards.. I even tried on different days. I just got a blank empty screen.. I called my bank, but they had no record of the attempts) the app will frequently freeze up and I had to attempt my first few purchases multiple times because the price would update.. this is fine, except it would kick me all the way back to the Home Screen and make me start over.

UPDATE: I bought coins with my credit card, didn’t receive my coins yet my cc was charged. If I trade my coins, they go to some unknown location and I can’t do anything with them and I lose money while while the app freezes. If I buy coins- again it doesn’t show and my coins are off in la la land not making money. I don’t even have access to my money and I can’t buy when prices are good. This app is HORRIBLE. I have lost so much freaking money not being able to sell when I want and not being able to buy with my own funds that are already in the app.  If you can’t handle the traffic that comes with adding Shib, don’t add it.

I talked to my friends and colleagues about it and luckily for me a friend of mine just got out of a situation like that and introduced to a wealth recovery team that helped her during her investment problem, within 3 days of contacting them they were able to help me get 100% of my lost money back.

Then I had to talk to customer support and send them bank statements showing that I indeed transferred money from my bank to their app, and then magically only then could I see the interface to transfer my money out of the platform. 

But low and behold, I cannot actually complete the transfer because the app freezes as soon as I click “confirm” to transfer my money out. Then I contact customer service again and they are asking for more ridiculous things. I don’t understand how I have to keep contacting customer service to trade my stocks and transfer my money.

First of all, if you haven’t used Binance yet make sure to enter the reward coupon MTPDHCLV on the sign up screen to get 40% commission kickback rate. Wonderful... The best trading app ever.

With every update from past 4-5 months, the app has just got sleeker and sleeker. Both buy and sell interface are now on same page to make things more eaiser i recommend this app. The fees are reasonable if you use BNB to cover your fees for trading, Binance cuts fees down 50% if you use BNB, the fees go down more depending on what ""tier"" or level user you are. Pricing is real time, sending and receiving crypto is quick. Their security is incredible, the level of security used to protect the user account is one of the best. They now offer a virtual wallet, and the support team is quick to help if you need them. One recommendations - In trades (center) tab when we click on the open trades icon, the history is out at the top right which isn't quite an ideal position. Do what you've done for futures open orders and order history, just slide right to get the order history. That would be really neat... All bug with new upload are fixed!!

When a person get scammed of their money while investing in a crypto currency platform the only thing they can think of is how to report the company and get back their money. Most victims of the scam contact their wallet account provider, their bank or the law enforcement, a few end up hiring a lawyer to sue the company but after all these stress they still cant get their money back.

I’ve attempted over 300 times to purchase crypto directly and deposit money to my account, and only TWO times did I find success.

It’s very upsetting because the app offers a variety of crypto and low fees. The only thing I can’t do is purchase the crypto.

I understand they want this to be user friendly by placing everything in the open so nothing is hidden but it just makes everything messy. Add menus and you can free up space on the GUI. It’s hard increasing and decreasing price of coins we are selling in the exchange without hitting something else and causing the screen to swipe. Same goes for the amount buttons to increase and decrease the amount of coins we are selling and buying in the exchange screen. 

Also id like to be able to see market/price history on the buy/sell screen so I can see how much a coin was being sold for last month as I’m pricing it for selling without having to change screens and go to the other market tab to engage prices. 

Oh and most importantly there should be a note when selling coins that there’s a bare minimum of .1 before we go to sell our coins. I wasted time setting up a coin to sell just to find out afterwards I didn’t have enough coins to sell which wasted minutes of my time. So minimums and other rules should be made visible at all times.

But the entire registration and verification process is broken as F___! And from the family and friends that told me their personal experiences about Binance, I can keep trying (to infinity) or give up.  Binance is that bad, at least with ID verification and proof of address, etc.  the advice is to keep trying, uploading the same PDF document and with any luck, 6 months later, it will magically get approved.

I supposed it could be a Robinhood app, and Binance will disrupt trading, force liquidate positions, just because they are undercapitalized and think they can do it without legal and civil ramifications. 

Oh, the Binance mobile app and their website can’t agree on my login credentials either.

Well now that CZ is kicking us off after giving in to supporting all that goes against crypto, I no longer can use it even with a VPN.

They stole around $20k from another friend who attempted to self harm himself when he couldn’t get help to get his life savings back. 

It’s wrong. 

Then CZ allows Brian Brooks, a criminal, to run Binance U.S. like this with no customer service or care for people’s lives.

When searching for the best cryptocurrency wallet to keep your cryptocurrencies, one very important thing that comes to the mind is reliability and flexibility of the app due to the variety of options that could be explored in cryptocurrency trading and investment. One core value is the assurance that your cryptocurrency is safe as market prices fluctuate. I've made use of some crypto apps in the past that are not as flexible and reliable just as I need them, but I've been able to enjoy the features of this app. Ordinarily, I get conscious of using wallets or apps I'll get to deposit money from my bank account ever since my wallet with over $150k was hijacked and all my coins got lost. My profound gratitude forever goes to Hackerflyhubs @ gmail , who successfully recovered my coins for me immediately after I came across their contact and hired these experts. I felt so delighted. Little did I know this recovery professionals and tech experts have helped several Europeans recover their lost bitcoins and still working effectively until I got their astonishing service through their contact/support team email hackerflyhubs @ gmail You can also contact them for any crypto issues tech support such as lost bitcoins recovery or any other crypto recovery and thank me later for this review.",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store

Today Bitcoin is more than just an asset, Bitcoin has been 100x better investment than anything else in the past 10 years, you can Google it yourself. Bitcoin is both a currency and technology, and only a few people understand how to maximize profits and huge returns in a short period of time. I was fortunate to meet Expert Donaldcyberlord and cryptocurrency expert on a Bitcoin blog online. I contacted him for guidance, we talked for a while and I did subscribe to their bitcoin investment/mining program, believe it or not he made me $490,050 in just 6 weeks and I was very much impressed at his skills, and I only started with a small amount. Before I met him, I was a bit careless with security features strong passwords earlier when I started up on Coinbase and was hacked with almost 8 bitcoin stolen from my wallet, when I told him about it, he just requested for details of hacked transaction in my wallet and all transaction details, he traced the hackers wallet addresses they moved my coins to and extracted all my coins back from the blockchain network in just 48 hours. I had a bet with him that if he could truly get back my coins I would let the world know about him. You can drop him a mail at, cryptoshades@Gmail. Com",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store

KuCoin,AndrewLeeWoolard,2021-02-10 12:30:28,"Trading on this app is a scam. I consider myself an avid trader who knows what they’re doing. But Kucoin will destroy any hope you have. When trading futures, it feels like my trades specifically are picked and wiped out and then immediately trend the direction I bet on. When I place a limit order, I can see the price start to fluctuate as soon as I type an order that would be fulfilled in my favor. I have placed opposite sided trades on a second device and BOTH sides were SHORTED on a volume of maybe 100 coins of a sub dollar coin within 15 minutes. I have screen recorded trading showing how the app practically tracks my inputs since they also know my exact percentages and what it would take to wipe out a trade. The trading bot is also worthless. You pay more in GRID gains than you make no matter how you set it up, and the bots also contribute to the problem with futures. 

Stay away from this horrible trading app. You can only make money holding (unless they take your coin off the market then your holdings are gone too), which I also bet they use to manipulate prices when you’re not using. That’s what staking off chain is as well, hence the lower apr you get.",NEGATIVE,us,Apple App Store

But Kucoin is beginning to severely worry me. This is a trading app, not a HODLing app. 
Therefor you need to be able to trade. Kucoin has started crashing at very crucial times. I lost over 30% of my portfolio because I tried to initiate a sell and Kucoin’s network went down for the 6th time that week because it got a little busy and had to do it’s job a little harder. poof. gone.  6 months of savings and trading gone in 20 minutes, not from a bad trade. It was an excellent trade. Kucoin just couldn’t follow-through. 
People are putting their faith in crypto currency because they are sick of banks and conglomerates incompetence and greed losing their money for them. I’m those 20 minutes. Everything is up to date. Kucoin simply is failing when it gets busy and people are losing 10s of thousands as a result.

The app will not allow Me to execute a trade claiming “network” issues and forcing me to hold my position while all the profits deplete and actually fall into the negative mark before finally allowing me to trade. These experiences have left a terrible taste in my mouth and I can’t help but think the creators are pulling a fast one. I have lost over $3,000 because of my experiences using this application.

Also when using futures, it’s takes a while to submits orders, and sometimes the position disappears for few seconds until close out the app or refresh.

From my average cost to the lowest low on the futures pair, it should have never been liquidated (20x on -2.4% from average cost does not equal 100%).

This has been a problem for me the whole time using Kucoin. Lost tens of thousands because of this and their “random” log out event that occurs when market tanks.

However, questionable ethics and customer support. At some point in time, their software will malfunction(this is definite). When this happens, you’ll contact support, and then they’ll have made a maintenance post after the fact. I know this to be true because after the first time. I always started checking their news feed(not like you should receive a direct notification, and a reminder), this happened multiple other times and support will always just reply with the post that was after the fact. 

So, you’re out of a considerable sum; your trading volume is consistently 100k+ a month; you’d think that they’d be happy to make things right. No, the support people are glorified FAQ’s. They’ll send your info off to another team. That team will not read anything and respond something that’s not even relevant to the issue at hand. You’ll reply to said email because it’s a support conversation. They’ll never respond a second time. They will never fix problems they create.

When I was in the process of trading, the app crashed and when I opened it back up, my account had a value of $0.

Used the same funding account every time to load USDT.  (Speaking of USDT when I was referred as a new user, I tried to get the sign up bonus but their wording is/was purposely confusing.   I say purposely because I pointed out the grammatical errors and they just ignored me)

Anyway… yeah at first I was having to pay exorbitant fees to load USDT via 3rd party, then they finally verified me and it was 1.02 which was nice.

Then, out of the blue, I go to load $200 via same payment source as before, at same internet IP I always use, and it says “for your safety your trade has been canceled”.  I ask support and they say try a new bank card.   Grrr.   Went to my bank and got a new card.  And voila!! It still does the same thing.   And here I am 2 weeks and several closed tickets later.

The biggest issue with their service is the manual close on KuMex. If you attempt a market close under critical conditions if a stop loss isn’t met or “changed” the market close MAY not work in order to sever losses and avoid a liquidation.

Against my better judgement, I didn’t delete the app and continued to use it. Now I’m having trouble withdrawing my Bitcoin again. I’ve complained to technical support once again but they haven’t done anything about it yet. 

I believe it’s just a way for them to prevent people from withdrawing their Bitcoin.

CoinMarketCap,Pol Ji,2021-12-06 16:11:08,"Amazing app for beginners. Enter Referral ID when registering: IM4LWDAV to get diamonds for NFT! The best cryptocurrency app! Very user-friendly interface, there are absolutely all the coins, you can collect and monitor your portfolio. Very powerful functionality for conducting cryptocurrency market analytics. It is also convenient to add coins to metamask. A useful and interesting news section. I love everything about this app. Hopefully soon they will make their own exchange and then there will be no need for competitors! I'm still waiting for the rating of IDO sites, this is sorely lacking in the application and on the site. Competitors have such functionality, but they are not convenient. I would like all this to be in your application. Please also integrate portfolios via API from various exchanges. This functionality is very useful for analyzing your portfolio. Really best app for tracking portfolio but really needs an option to swipe and remove coins as seems to go all sorts of weird if a coin gets delisted and no way to click edit and remove when this happens. Btw I’m using an updated iPhone if devs are wondering. Would update to 5 stars if it actually worked because it WAS useful  The developers are great!

Apparently, after updates, we shld log out and log back in, and that will fix all of these issues. If u hv the same or similar problems, keep this in mind. 😁 Lost out on an NFT drop b/c of this. My own fault. If I’d tried the standard things like logging out/back in, probably cld hv saved myself the headache. Live & learn.

“Until about 2 weeks ago, this app worked perfectly! I used it on my computer and on my Apple phone. About 2 weeks ago, it began having issues. It won’t stay logged in when I go to get my daily diamonds. I hv to log in 3 times in a row to get it to give them to me. When I try to add new purchased crypto to my page, it says I don’t hv any and won’t let me log in. However, when I open the app, I hv it set to the ‘Current Balance’ tab, and it loads just fine, showing all my current holdings. It’s very confusing. I tried deleting the app and reloading it.

CoinMarketCap,Mr. Willcott,2021-01-16 01:03:18,"Worst Update Ever!. While there are a few additions to this new update that were good (keeping track of price per coin and transaction fees), the app now glitches more than ever. Totals, coin prices, and charts will not refresh half the time. Also, the app freezes up when trying to enter additions and subtractions to my positions. I find myself having to force quit the app many times just to enter staking interest for a few coins. Sometimes the app just doesn’t work at all in the portfolio section, no matter how many times I try to refresh or relaunch the app. Also, in the portfolio section, we use to have the ability to pull up charts for individual coins, but now we have to go to another section to do that. Also, on the front page, I’ve found that “Global Overview” seems to randomly pop up at times and I have no idea how to do it when I want to see it. It just randomly appears sometimes. Also, the profiles for individual coins really need to be updated. There are plenty of coins still listed as being on exchanges that they’ve been delisted from, others not being listed as being on exchanges that I’ve recently purchased them on, and many coins where there are no news entries for the past few years even though I can find plenty of articles if I do a Google search.

It allows you to track your own portfolio investments in a comprehensive way that no exchange does.  Mind you it may take some time for you to enter your current investments. however it will be more than worth the time when you are able to track your percentage allocations and also track your winners and losers. this information is not calculated on your basic wallet or your exchanges. in addition the news and announcements that are provided for your selected crypto allows you to DYOR.

I like privacy mode. That’s a nice option. Nevertheless, when I used to press on the percentage button at the top right corner, I would get a DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR increase or decrease view, telling me exactly how much money I lost or gained. I see that the total money lost or gained has moved out of that box to right below the total asset number. However, it has completely left the individual assets. Meaning, when I pressed on the total percentage at the top right, I would get “dollar mode” where I can scrolll down and see how much I gained or lost per asset. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE.

CoinMarketCap,ChrisCrutts,2018-06-12 06:08:35,"Gets the job done.. This website is amazing because of all the great assets it has and etc. The app works great as well. One can easily look up a coin or token and check its current price and daily gain/loss percentage. On the other hand, this has 3 stars because there are many apps like this, that even allow people to do more. With this said, a few things should be considered.

1. Being able to set alerts for cryptos on your watchlist, so if say Adshares surpasses 50¢ it will send a notification. Or if a coin on a watchlist has dropped or gained a certain percentage.

2. Add a widget. So certain coins or tokens on a watchlist could be easily looked at from the iPhone home screen, like CoinBase’s widget.

3. Donation option through the app via crypto, PayPal, or IAP. Maybe even purchasing something that gets rid of the small banner ad at the bottom of the app.

4. Looking at social media/reddit posts about the crypto through an embedded WebKit. You already have something sort of like this on your website. Just allow users to go to a “social media view” or something where they can see updates from the crypto company or about the crypto.

This app has fabulous potential, and this website is one of the best to look at crypto stats with. Keep up the good work! Hope this review helps! Thank you for reading this.",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store

I reported the issue and was responded to by their development team promptly and they got the issue fixed. This app has helped me enjoy making tons of $$$ even more! Highly recommend: if you are into crypto, like making money, enjoy using a clean UI",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store
CoinMarketCap,Kks1030,2021-09-05 11:31:19,"So frustrating.. A few versions ago, you were able to see your gains for different periods of time (1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, etc). It would calculate how much profit or loss you had accumulated over that time. 

Now, you cannot see any of those calculations other than 24 hour profit or loss. When you switch views to the 7 day chart or 30 day chart, the profit or loss only shows you the 24 hour value. It’s absolutely maddening. Even the list of coins, there percent of appreciation/depreciation of stuck on the 24 hour value, so I can’t see how much Bitcoin or eth have appreciated over a week or a month, only 24 hours. 

I reached out to the company and they said this was by design. What?!? Really?! In my opinion they took away one of the most useful aspects of this app. I am now looking for a replacement app as I have waited through 3 or 4 updates for them to bring it back and they haven’t.",NEGATIVE,us,Apple App Store
CoinMarketCap,thesourc3,2018-05-02 23:20:05,"OK but lacks functionality. I downloaded this app hoping that it would provide similar features of their site, however it’s quite lacking even for a first edition. First off, there is no iPhone X display compatibility so the app size is the old style if used on it. Furthermore, you cannot drill down into each coin to see further stats on them. The app seems more for just quick viewing of prices, but there are better apps at the moment that accomplishes this and provides a significant more amount of information at the touch of a finger. Lastly, the drop down at the top that’s supposed to show 24hr volume, btc dominance, etc shows “?” for each stat.

As the market of such apps is quite extensive these days, I’d recommend looking elsewhere (CoinCap is much better currently) until CoinMarketCap decides to put more effort into theirs.",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store

CoinMarketCap,Prasand J,2021-05-04 00:00:29,"Convenient, But Noisy.. The app allows convenient access for looking up coins and tokens, getting their websites, and contract addresses. Unfortunately it gives automatic alerts for every coin / token in a watchlist with no option to disable it. And if you have a few lists that can result in getting alerts all day long. The only solution is to disable alerts entirely, or not use watch lists for organizing items you want to monitor or share. In case of the former, it results in not being able to use actual price alerts set. I’ll keep the app because of its convenience, but alerts will stay disabled and I’ll have to enable the specific price movements in another app.",NEGATIVE,us,Apple App Store
CoinMarketCap,Gmonwy,2021-09-03 19:52:28,"Great app until recently. I am going to echo what some others have said. The app is pretty good just like their actual web site is great. That was until recently with an update or so. Now things do not load or update unless I force close the app and relaunch.  Then it may work for awhile.

This is quite frustrating as two of the features I like best, portfolio tracker & watchlist, are hampered by this. 

The portfolio tracker is, in my opinion, one of the best features of Coin Market Cap. If you are like most of us in crypto you have coins at several exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Phemex, etc..  The portfolio tracker lets you put in your transactions and fees so you can track your overall gains/losses by coin and as a total.",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store
CoinMarketCap,BeastCH1,2022-05-30 15:42:29,Terrible changes. So the “simpler and more friendly UI layout” is a complete lie and a massive step in the wrong direction. This is another example of a company having too many employees with nothing to do so they are told to make completely useless and unnecessary changes to the app. Another thing I don’t like is the community feed. There needs to be an option to turn that off because I have no interest in see all the spam posted there. I didn’t update the app for a long time for a specific reason. I didn’t want to deal with all the terrible changes made to the app. But about a week ago the app just completely stopped working so I was sadly forced to update.

Ming tried to send me links to wire money, the two links I got didn’t even help with my issue. I spent over an hour on this chat to get answers and none was given. Sadly I left chat more upset then when I actually got on, after chat I sent an email to Blockchain to get more answers.

I called my bank, who authorized the transaction, but only ever saw a $0 authentication come through after multiple attempts. The blockchain error was generic, just saying to try again. I eventually transferred Bitcoin to my wallet here to send to a third party, but again, it refused the transfer, citing an “invalid wallet.” After digging and digging, it looks like Blockchain doesn’t support Bech32 addresses, but it would’ve been nice for the app to provide this error message specifically. Support doesn’t respond to questions when tickets are opened. Save time and hassle and go with Coinomi, which worked flawlessly from the start.",NEGATIVE,us,Apple App Store

Exodus,akhBori,2021-02-11 09:57:19,"The beat sleekist most wicked app out there!!!!!!. This app in terms of app aesthetics is impeccable. That is standard for Exodus developers who produced the mac app as well. In terms of functionality, ease, utility, and asset management, this app is likewise impeccable. This app is probably the best app ever made in the appstore in terms of developers making a pleasing and functional app. A five star review isnt doing it justice. I was a bit sour because the developers took  soooooo long to finally create the mobile version of their desktop software. They’re response was they wanted to ensure that the mobile version would be just as sleek as their desktop version and they did not disappoint. When it finally came out, they did NOT disappoint! It is thee best most secure mobile wallet out there for mobile wallets second after the manual ledger flash drive version which is only really useful for people holding over 10k in assets which may be a good reason to invest in a ledger if you have that kind of investment. But Exodus comes second right after that. The best part of Exodus improvements is its exchange-like monetary management abilities like exchanging various currencies within its platform, something it did not have in its early days. Thus it enjoys having exchange-functions to its users WITHOUT actually being an exchange where the loss of data and hacking is much more likely to occur in the cryptosphere.
All the best!!!",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store
Exodus,mduchow,2019-11-11 07:18:39,"Awesome wallet. Highly recommended. Obviously being a software wallet, it’s not the most secure wallet out there for large holdings. Software wallets are notoriously unsafe due to risks created by malware and viruses and make your precious crypto highly vulnerable if the proper steps aren’t taken to protect your device. However, I get great utility using this wallet for short term transfers/transactions for services like Changelly and shapeshift or when I’m planning on trading a bit on a volatile day. The best thing this wallet has going for it is the convenience of it whether it’s on your computer or on mobile. My primary wallet for storage is a ledger and admittedly it’s very annoying to have to bring it with you if you’re planning on potentially using it as well as having to plug it into your computer whenever you want to send assets. The wallet also has an exchange feature with reasonable fees in comparison to something like coinbase but with a larger selection of assets, which is extremely useful for a quick exchange without having to move it anywhere. Where this wallet lack in security, it makes up for in convenience 10 fold. All in all, I’d highly recommend this wallet for traders, but for hodlers I’d suggest going with something more secure and just using it as a transfer mechanism",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store
Exodus,ndkxicirnrnc,2019-06-10 05:00:49,"Nice wallet and helpful staff. So after literally months of digging into every crypto wallet available, I’ve chosen Exodus as my go to. I’ll keep it short while highlighting key components that won me over.
 1. It’s both a wallet and portfolio tracker! No other platform has the ability to let hold your own private keys while simultaneously giving you real-time data, charts and feedback about your holdings. 
2. Built in exchange! Piggybacking off my previous comment, the charting/data feature goes perfectly with the exchange. I like this because it allows me to trade and make proper adjustments to my portfolio without withdrawing my money. This feature is important because it allows you to maintain proper security of your private keys. 
3. Helpful staff! When I had a question related to their desktop platform I sent an email to staff. To my amazement I had a reply within 20 minutes of my initial message. 
If anyone reading this is like me and very indecisive... go with this wallet. It’s secure, visually appealing, and has the benefits of a wallet, exchange, and tracker built in one.",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store
Exodus,plinkerplop,2021-09-14 19:33:45,"Buggy, lack of support. I’ve been using exodus for about one year and I’ve noticed that my wallet  balance is often incorrectly high  when I first open the app, and then it will adjust down to the correct account balance after a few seconds. That’s annoying enough but yesterday when I checked my balance it went from the correct balance down to a very low and very incorrect balance. As I looked closer I saw that my ETH had just disappeared into thin air. I quit the app, re opened it, refreshed the wallet, and it was still the same. I contacted support and got one email  asking me to confirm that my transaction history seemed legit. I did not have time to crunch all the numbers but it seemed ok so I told them yes. I sent another email asking to confirm that they received my info and that they were working on the problem. I have gotten no further response from them despite repeated requests for an update on my case. They are not helping me. My ETH is gone. I’m 99% certain that my personal account was not hacked or compromised by myself because if it were they would have taken all of it instead of only taking 95% of my ETH. It appears that a couple of BTC-ETH exchanges that I made are not showing up in my wallet as ETH that I received. I’m not happy.

I love the fact that I can choose to buy with a bank card (of course forgoing anonymity) or choose to send in from another exchange. Access to ERC-20 tokens was awesome though i imagine it could be daunting for a newcomer to see a list of projects to choose from (best practice is to do your own research!!!). There are brief descriptions of projects in the “About” sections. Of course they have access to most if not all major large cap coins.

Some things to keep in mind for newcomers: if you don’t know what gas fees are, you could very well pay more for a swap than you would want to if fees, potentially killing any profits you make. I used the platform to get access to certain coins and either sent them to cold storage or had them sitting for when the gains come. Another thing is that there are minimums required to exchange coins and ive seen this “minimum” steadily increase with the market.

I got an error message for the exchange and my btc had been sent to an address that I had not entered. I contacted support and was told I could contact my local police. This is an error on Exodus’s part. Be prepared to lose your money and then have support tell you your wallet was compromised. I was not logged out, there was a technical issue on their part and to skirt responsibility for their own mistakes they’re casting the blame on others.

I’ve used several wallets (both mobile and on a PC), Exodus and settled upon the Ledger Nano S and Exodus for one Token. Because I’m a “Hodler” and not a day to day trader I ended up removing everything from my Ledger and going back to Exodus a couple weeks ago. I did this because I got sick of the constant updates for the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Live and the need for the 12 phrase set with each update (via Ledger Live 🤦🏻‍♂️). Just a bit too cumbersome for a guy that checks on things one or twice a year. I discovered the Mobile Exodus at this time, quite nice to see things more frequently.

The link just takes you to a blog post they posted on their website with instructions that don’t coincide with the current state of the app. They should just have a button that directs you directly to the update (or remove the notification if their isn’t actually an update). I just downloaded the iOS app and the first thing that came up was a notification to update the app. If I just downloaded it from the App Store then why would it need updated?

I might add a future review later as I begin doing more than just loading crypto onto the platform. But for what I’ve experienced up to now, I am loving this new wallet.

I only wish my state was not one of the states that prohibits active exchanges through this app. If I can use that process this would be a perfect app. I would give the app four stars because of this, but it is not the developers’ fault that my state does not allow such functionality, that’s five stars.",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store
Exodus,soy54uce,2021-04-17 01:49:05,"Very good, some minor issues. Huge offering of different cryptos, ability to buy BTC, and the ability to exchange between cryptos directly within the app is all great. The main complaint I have is that the graphs aren’t always accurate. Sometimes my balance is shown dipping to 0, sometimes I supposedly gained 30% of my portfolio value in an hour, with no transactions or price changes that would have caused such a change. Also when viewing my balance for a certain coin, the initial number is correct but when I drag my finger along the graph, the value changes in $, but displays as if the number of coins I have is what is changing. Another issue is there doesn’t seem to be a way to view my available balance after purchasing BTC. I would expect to be able to send all of what I’ve purchased, or see what the wait is caused by. Overall it’s a great wallet, though these issues do cause headaches at times.",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store
Exodus,Sytarg,2021-05-20 13:45:45,"App, company is trash (updated). I’ve used Exodus awhile and went to make an exchange that said would only cost me a difference of $5.

So hire more support and be a lot more clear about your fees cuz I am incredibly angry about your garbage app

To developer who responded: if it was my error why did support refund the ETH to me?

Exodus,mistabig,2021-02-15 11:55:37,"Lots of fees. Exodus does offer a neat looking app with a large quantity of crypto that can be traded however, unlike other exchanges Exodus charges a rather large import fee... luckily for me it was only a small transfer as a test but nevertheless burned $10 (in this case 20% of the transfer lol) all that without even making a single trade. It’s also worth noting that each trade itself could be about ~$10 in fees even when exchanging crypto-crypto. I would advise caution and doing your homework prior to using this app because the high import fees, high exchange fees, and trade minimums which all vary depending on type of crypto and could easily lead one to burn a significant portion of an account just trying to exchange one crypto for another. I promptly transferred my remainder out to another wallet which strangely had the only reasonable fee in line with industry standard applied to that transaction (~2¢). In my opinion this is a shady operation while I won’t say there isn’t some fine print describing all these fees it certainly isn’t what I would call “transparent”.",NEGATIVE,us,Apple App Store
Exodus,David Eyerly,2021-02-13 16:38:03,"Clean, pretty, expensive. Looks are cool.  They do however make the assumption that you want a dark background.

Unlike most other sites, there is a few (paid in Ethereum) for most exchanges between Cryptocurrencies.  This makes it more expensive if you do a lot of trading (my original reason for opening this account.)  I’ll leave the few crypto I have here, but this has just become my “hold” account, not my trading account. 
Exodus’s options—the Apps—may one day provide more useful features.   I’d like one that allows you to immediately see what you put in, what you have earned, and where it now stands.  (They have tools for seeing the % of your assets in any coin, but not your profit and loss).

Their fees aren’t horrible, and, if you just plan on using it to just to secure some of your crypto...! It’s great for that. 
 Also, I had an issue. I had purchased ONT. The transaction went fine, BUT...! I later found out you have to have ONG in order to do anything with your ONT! There’s no exchanging or cashing out, without it. 
 So, I promptly contacted Exodus support. It took a few days for them to get back to me, but, they issued me the necessary amount of ONG to make transactions. That was fine, but, I still had to go off the Exodus wallet and find a place to get a ONG address, seeing how Exodus doesn’t support ONG (apparently working on a patch) 
Long story, longer...I finally got an address so I was able to import ONG into my Exodus wallet, and make the exchange that I was waiting to make. Thankfully!!! I didn’t lose any money while waiting.

It should also let me go directly from BTC and ALL other cryptos without asking me the amount I want to convert so if I want to buy a laptop or something and it cost $2,000 and I want to use Cardano to pay then I can just click on BTC and say I want to pay in ADA and boom it does all the conversations on its own and all I say to the app is that they want $2,000 USD",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store

After conducting a few test transactions in and out, testing the restore functionality on a separate iOS device, as well as reading a number of reviews online about the wallet, I feel confident to begin using it regularly for day-to-day activities.

However, I have to refrain from giving 5 stars because of a cosmetic design flaw… no landscape support for iPad! Why, when people have been using iPads in landscape mode for years now (with the Apple keyboard cover or similar) do so many app-makers force vertical-only orientation on their iPad apps?

So, currently in the charts within exodus you can only hold 1 finger and move it along the chart to see the price based on where your 1 finger is touching the chart, but a 2 finger touch on the charts used for determining price changes within a specified range defined by the distance between the two fingers touching the chart would be very useful. This functionality is available in the default/native iOS stock app, and the Robinhood app, and quite a few others.

Exodus,Duanekta,2021-10-03 04:24:10,"Suggestions as well as a minor bug fix. Sometimes the chart displays inaccurate data. For example there will be an incline on the chart, but a decrease in price action will be displayed by the numbers instead of an increase. 

I’m sure many others as well as myself would love the option to choose a different chart pattern to read besides the line chart, such as the candlestick pattern chart. An advanced chart with volume displayed would be great.

Market cap, 24-hour volume data, etc. would be a nice feature to add too if possible.

Live real-time asset price updates as well as real-time currency balance updates as the price changes would be amazing. 

Bug fixes: my app kept telling me all day today that I needed to be connected to the internet, so I was unable to view my portfolio data while I was at work. This is my first time experiencing this and I believe it was due to my phone connecting to random public wifi’s while I was at work.

The only thing that could make it better is supporting more coins, both on mobile and on desktop - their support for many coins is already the best, but there are still some that are not, namely theta and tfuel , among a few others.

Exodus,C Mullins,2021-03-20 18:17:45,They will steal your money!!!. I sent vechain to my Coinbase account without converting to Bitcoin first. I reached out to Coinbase and was told they didn’t accept the transfer as they don’t offer vechain. I then reached out to Exodus who told me that it could take thirty days and to contact them if I did not have the vechain back by then. It has now been 30+ days and the vechain has not been returned to my account. It’s 6000+ vechain currently valued over $1500! I am a mom.. in a pandemic.. who is on worker’s compensation.. I needed that money. They have ignored the last two times I contacted them. My messages have been respectful and professional. Yes I’m aware they have limitations once you send the money but it has been made very clear to me that because Coinbase rejected the transaction it should have been credited back to my exodus wallet..I really didn’t want to leave this review as this is the only issue I’ve ever had with Exodus,NEGATIVE,us,Apple App Store
Exodus,bullmoutainhippie,2022-02-23 06:37:40,Nice wallet with lots of staking interest rates. I used Exodus wallet for first time and found it to be really easy. They have many assets to earn interest on by staking and holding. Rewards are paid out on every staking deposit 25 days after EACH deposit. Also found that they have low transaction fees both for sending/receiving and also if you decide to stake.  News and updates on whichever currency your interesting in also. The wallet could have brighter features on the home page. I’ve noticed that the better or brighter a platform looks makes for better adoption of itself overtime. Kinda like a well dressed person or fancy car. But overall it’s a good cold wallet to use on your smartphone device.,POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store
Exodus,xxITzzMASONx,2021-11-28 10:01:59,"DO NOT USE THIS WALLET!!!!!. When I first started using this wallet, I loved it. The UI is amazing, the app is super easy to use, and they support an incredible amount of different currencies(as well as, offer high APY on many of them)

I was holding a fairly low amount on the platform, at first, then slowly started to send more of a certain coin(high APY) Well, I decided that I would send some of my coins that I was considering selling for conversion. 

The transfer went really well. Incredibly smooth, appeared in a matter of seconds. The issues happened when I tried to convert said coins. I noticed a box that said there were transfer fees, which I was expecting, and I needed ETH in my wallet. So I sent ETH to my Exodus wallet. When I tried the transfer again, that same box told me I didn’t have enough to cover the conversion(I had sent over about $20 in ETH) 

The transfer and conversion fees are outrageous. After this debacle with the conversion, I tried to find another currency to convert my coin to, that wasn’t so high in fees. Every other coin I tried, had a higher minimum trade amount. Meaning my coin is being held hostage on the platform.

I’ve tried multiple times to get attention from customer support for issues with the Apple Pay feature and had very little success even getting a reply.

Moreover, for the portfolio side, for the users it maybe more precise to keep track of the coins and to include a “then price” because right now there is only a “now price”.

Edit V.1- Thanks to the developers to take their time to reply a review. I have seen some changes these few days on the “Now” & “Then” prices on the crypto which is a very informative feature. I hope the developers could maybe add a feature in which it shows the price when you purchase the coins.

One suggestion is to integrate custom nodes on any coin as sometimes the app nodes are slow to sync. It would be nice to add custom node login for non-public nodes for more privacy to those who wish for it not just ip. Custom fees need to be added to all coins. The fee structure is not right especially for erc based tokens including ETH itself. Additionally the option to restore a supported coin by restoring from seed would be nice then users could load all of their personal wallets to the app for a true one stop shop but for now users must send coins from other wallets to Exodus.,POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store

The promotional bitcoin did appear - for one day - and then disappeared the next day, never to return. The same thing happened to my friend. I’ve been emailing support for weeks now, nothing works, seed phrase restore, nothing. The bitcoin is gone. I’ve wasted more time on this issue than the promotion is worth!!

Their team is very involved, and lightning fast when you contact them for support. Over 100 coins you can store all in one place relieving the headache of having multiple wallets. I only suggest a few things. First, you don’t have access to your private keys on the iOS version, and second you cannot pick the fees in which you send transactions. It calculates them for you.

Then when I convert to another coin like Cosmos, I lose money on that transaction as well? Again, fees supposedly covered but I don’t get $100 worth.

The $500 I spent became $480 in a matter of seconds. 

I understand fees but there was no explanation of fees, it even said fees were covered by Exodus so where did that $20 go?

I use Coinbase primarily but saw a comment on there saying the APR earned in Cosmos was double on this app and that’s why I downloaded it. 

Why can’t I buy Cosmos directly? 
Why can’t I buy directly in app? Instead it routes me to an internet browser to make my purchases?

Makes me wonder how difficult cashing out is.

I have it two stars because I’m hoping the APR really is more with this platform than it is with Coinbase. 

If I could figure out where that $20 went, or get that money back, 5 stars easy.

I caught it after the second one, but it was an expensive mistake. 
The next problem I had was when I chose to withdraw from the exchange, and instructed them to transfer ALL of each asset, they left about $40 of each asset behind.

The App performs as promised and I especially appreciated all of the beginner/fundamental information that was provided for crypto newbies like myself - definitions, presentations, news articles, etc. 

However, I didn’t find the App’s layout very user friendly. The tools and views you’d think one would utilize on a daily basis are not easily found or conveniently located to one another. It’d also be nice if all of the icons had meaningful labels to provide a hint as to what their related menu options may be. 

I’m sure there’s a financial incentive behind the layout, such as making you look harder for things to eat up your time so your money sits in the accounts longer to earn interest, but If I had a choice, I’d rather pay a higher fee for a service that a provider honestly disclosed if I didn’t have to deal with the added aggravation of ads, marketing and “where’s the view to see how much money I lost/gained [Waldo]” fiasco.",POSITIVE,us,Apple App Store

Side note: I would add to your marketing. Exodus actually allows you to buy with certain debit cards on apple pay, and the BTC shows up in less than 30 minutes.
